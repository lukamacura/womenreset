  return `I understand you're looking for information about medications or dosages. I'm not able to provide specific medication recommendations or dosage advice, as these need to be determined by your healthcare provider based on your individual health profile.

For questions about:
- **Specific medications** (like Premarin, Estrace, etc.) → Please consult your doctor or pharmacist
- **Dosage questions** → Your healthcare provider will determine the right dosage for you
- **Prescription advice** → This requires a medical evaluation

I can help you with:
- General information about HRT and how it works
- Understanding menopause symptoms and phases
- Lifestyle strategies to support your menopause journey
- Questions about your symptoms and experiences

Would you like to explore any of these topics instead? 💜`;
