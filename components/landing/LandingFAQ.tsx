      question: "What can I ask Lisa?",
      answer:
        "Anything about menopause. Hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings, brain fog, weight gain, sleep problems, HRT, supplements, vaginal dryness, libido changes — nothing is off limits. Lisa is trained on menopause research and gives you clear, calm answers without judgment.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is Lisa a real person?",
      answer:
        "Lisa is an AI trained specifically on menopause research and education. She's available 24/7, never rushes you, and never judges. She gives research-backed information — not medical advice. Always consult your doctor for treatment decisions.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is this different from Googling?",
      answer:
        "Google gives you 50 different answers, half of them terrifying. Lisa gives you one clear, research-backed explanation written for real women, not medical journals. No clickbait, no scare tactics, no trying to sell you supplements.",
    },
    {
      question: "What makes MenoLisa different from other tracking apps?",
      answer:
        "Most apps just track. MenoLisa explains. Lisa answers your questions, helps you understand your patterns, and gives you the knowledge to advocate for yourself at doctor's appointments. It's a companion, not just a tracker.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is my data private?",
      answer: "Yes. Your conversations with Lisa and your symptom data are encrypted and never shared. Only you can see them.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does the guarantee work?",
      answer:
        "Use MenoLisa for 7 days. If you don't feel more informed and in control, email us for a full refund. No questions, no hoops. We can offer this because most women who try Lisa never go back to guessing.",
