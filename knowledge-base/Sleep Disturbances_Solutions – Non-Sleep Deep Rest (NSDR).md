  Sometimes sleep doesn’t come — and that’s okay 💜. NSDR (Non-Sleep Deep Rest) is your bridge between wakefulness and sleep, helping your body learn how to rest again.
  
  This gentle practice guides you into deep relaxation through slow breathing and body awareness. It calms your nervous system, lowers cortisol, and signals your brain that it’s safe to drift. Studies show even a 10–20 minute session can restore focus, improve emotional balance, and prepare your body for real sleep 🌙.
  
  You can use NSDR anytime: before bed, during a 3 a.m. wake-up, or midday for a recharge. The more you practice, the faster your body learns to find rest naturally — even when sleep feels out of reach.

action_tips:
  - "🎧 **Find a guided NSDR audio** (YouTube)."
  - "🕯️ **Lie down comfortably** with eyes closed, arms relaxed, and no pressure to sleep."
  - "🌬️ **Breathe slowly** — in for 4, out for 6 — letting each exhale soften your body."
  - "🧘 **Allow thoughts to pass** like clouds; don’t chase or judge them."
  - "🕑 **Practice for 10–20 minutes** daily or whenever rest feels hard to reach."

motivation_nudge: "🌸 Deep rest is a skill — not a luxury. Each session trains your body to feel safe enough to sleep again."
