content_text: |
  You absolutely *can* lose weight in menopause — but the old methods stop working because your body's operating system has changed 💜.
  
  Hormones, muscle mass, sleep, and stress all shift how your metabolism burns energy. Eating less and exercising more often backfires — your body reads it as stress and holds on tighter.
  
  The new formula? **Build muscle, balance blood sugar, sleep deeply, and calm stress**. When your hormones feel safe, your body lets go of stored energy again 🌿.

action_tips:
  - "🏋️ Strength train 2–3× weekly — muscle is your metabolic engine."
  - "🥗 Eat protein at every meal (25–30 g) to balance insulin and reduce cravings."
  - "🌙 Protect sleep and lower stress — calm hormones burn fat more easily."
  - "🚶‍♀️ Add daily movement — even walking after meals improves fat metabolism."
  - "💧 Stay hydrated — water supports digestion and hormone detoxification."

motivation_nudge: "🌸 You're not chasing a size — you're building a body that will support and sustain you for the next beautiful chapter of your life."

habit_strategy: |
  **Rebalance First, Then Burn** — When hormones and sleep are steady, the body can release stored fat instead of protecting it.
  
  Focus on protein, resistance training, and stress relief before cutting calories — this teaches your body it's safe to burn energy again.
  
  💪 **Tip:** Calm, fuel, move — the new three-step rule for sustainable weight loss.
