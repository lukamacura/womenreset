content_text: |
  Progesterone is estrogen's steadying partner 🌙. When you take estrogen and still have a uterus, progesterone keeps the uterine lining from thickening — protecting you from endometrial cancer. It also has gentle, calming effects on sleep and mood.
  
  💡 Two key roles:
  • Protects the uterus from unopposed estrogen stimulation.
  • Helps some women sleep better and feel more emotionally balanced.
  
  ✅ Safest form: Micronized (body-identical) progesterone is identical to your body's own hormone. It has a lower breast-cancer and clot risk compared to older synthetic progestins, and many women tolerate it beautifully.
  
  If your uterus was removed, you usually don't need progesterone — estrogen alone is sufficient.

action_tips:
  - "🌙 Take it at night: Natural progesterone can gently support sleep and calm the nervous system."
  - "🩺 Confirm your form: If you have a uterus, discuss whether micronized (body-identical) progesteronen or an IUS device fits your lifestyle best."
  - "💬 Monitor mood & bloating: If side effects appear, timing or dosage tweaks often help."

motivation_nudge: "🌿 Progesterone brings balance and protection — it's the quiet partner that keeps estrogen's power safe and steady."
