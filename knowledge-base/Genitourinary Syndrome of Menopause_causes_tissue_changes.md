content_text: |
  When estrogen levels fall after menopause 💜, tissues that depend on it — like the vagina, bladder, and urethra — lose elasticity, moisture, and natural protection. Blood flow decreases and collagen weakens, leaving the area more fragile and prone to irritation or infection 🌿. These changes are known as **genitourinary syndrome of menopause** (GSM) — but the good news is, with care and treatment, tissue health can recover.
action_tips:
  - "💧 Use **vaginal moisturizers** regularly to support hydration and elasticity."
  - "🥤 Stay hydrated and avoid **harsh soaps or wipes** that disrupt pH balance."
  - "🚭 Avoid **smoking**, which reduces blood flow and delays healing."
motivation_nudge: "🌸 These changes are reversible — your tissues can regain comfort and strength with consistent care."

follow_up_question: “What would you like to explore next: the most common GSM symptoms (and the emotional side), solutions—non-hormonal and hormonal options or a daily comfort routine to prevent flare-ups?"
