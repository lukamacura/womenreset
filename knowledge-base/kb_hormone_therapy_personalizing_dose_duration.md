content_text: |
  Menopausal Hormone Therapy (MHT) isn't one-size-fits-all 💜. Every woman's biology, history, and goals are unique — so your dose, formulation, and duration should be too.
  
  The safest approach is to start with the lowest effective dose that relieves symptoms and protects long-term health. As your body adapts, your clinician may fine-tune your estrogen–progesterone balance for best results. Duration depends on your needs: some women use MHT for a few years to calm hot flashes or sleep issues, while others continue longer for bone, brain, or heart benefits under medical supervision.
  
  There's no universal 'expiration date' — what matters is safety, symptom control, and how you feel.

action_tips:
  - "🩺 Partner with your clinician: Schedule regular check-ins every 6–12 months to review symptoms, side effects, and lab results."
  - "🧬 Start low and go slow: Small adjustments can make big differences — balance comfort and safety."
  - "📓 Track your response: Keep a simple log of mood, sleep, energy, and hot flashes to guide follow-ups."
  - "🌙 Reevaluate yearly: Hormone needs evolve as your natural estrogen stabilizes."
  - "💗 Balance benefits and comfort: Continue therapy as long as it improves your quality of life and remains safe."

motivation_nudge: "Personalized therapy is power 🌸 — your plan should fit you, not a chart. It's not about being on hormones forever; it's about feeling well for as long as it serves your body."
