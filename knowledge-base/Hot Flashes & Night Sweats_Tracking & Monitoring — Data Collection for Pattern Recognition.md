 Tracking your symptoms is one of the smartest things you can do 🌸. It helps you spot patterns, identify triggers, and notice real progress — even when improvement feels slow.
 Objective data gives you confidence when adjusting habits or talking to your doctor 💜. Tracking transforms frustration into insight and empowers informed decision-making 🌿.
action_tips:
 - "📱 Log 4 data points per hot flash: (1) Time of day, (2) Duration in minutes, (3) Severity 1-10 scale, (4) Preceding trigger hypothesis."
 - "📊 Use validated tracking apps, or printable MRS (Menopause Rating Scale) questionnaire."
 - "🔍 Track for minimum 2 weeks before changing interventions — this establishes baseline and reveals true patterns versus random variation."
 - "💤 Include sleep metrics: hours slept, number of night sweat awakenings, next-day fatigue rating 1-10."
 - "💬 Bring quantified data to appointments: 'I'm averaging 12 flashes daily, 6/10 severity, disrupting sleep 4 nights/week' is more actionable than 'I'm suffering.'"

motivation_nudge: "✨ Every data point you collect is a step toward personalized relief — small awareness creates big insights and targeted solutions."
