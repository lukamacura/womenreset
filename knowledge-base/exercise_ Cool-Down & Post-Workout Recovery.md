  You’ve worked hard 💪 — now let’s help your body *land softly*.

  A **cool-down** is your bridge from activity to rest. It lowers heart rate, relaxes muscles, and prevents that heavy, stiff feeling later on.

  For women in midlife, this phase is gold: it supports hormone balance, reduces hot flash triggers, and soothes your nervous system after intensity. A few calm minutes make a huge difference in recovery and sleep quality.

  ✨ Think of it as your *self-care finish line* — a moment to reset, breathe, and thank your body.

action_tips:
  - "🌙 **Wind Down:** Walk or pedal gently for 5–10 minutes to bring your heart rate down."
  - "🧘 **Stretch:** Focus on hamstrings, hips, and chest — hold each for 20–30 seconds."
  - "💖 **Breathe Deeply:** Slow inhales through the nose, long exhales through the mouth to calm your system."
  - "🔄 **Add Mindfulness:** Finish with 30 seconds of gratitude or stillness — let your body and mind settle."

motivation_nudge: "💜 Those quiet minutes after your workout aren’t optional — they’re where your body *absorbs* the benefits."
