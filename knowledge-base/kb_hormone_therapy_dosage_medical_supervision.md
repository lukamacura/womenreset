  Hormone therapy works best — and safest — when guided by expert eyes 💜. There's no universal 'standard' dose of estrogen, progesterone, or testosterone. Your ideal range depends on your age, health, and how your body responds.
  
  That's why ongoing supervision matters: a menopause-trained clinician monitors your symptoms, adjusts doses, and keeps therapy within a safe, effective range. Self-adjusting or ordering hormones online can be risky — product quality and dosing are often unreliable.
  
  Think of your clinician as your partner in calibration, helping you stay balanced, not overdone 🌿.

action_tips:
  - "🩺 Work with a menopause-certified clinician: They'll customize your dose and monitor your progress safely."
  - "📋 Schedule regular reviews: At first every 3–6 months, then yearly once stable."
  - "📓 Keep a symptom log: Track mood, sleep, and energy to guide dose adjustments."

motivation_nudge: "Supervised care isn't control — it's collaboration 🌸. You and your clinician co-create a plan that keeps therapy safe and effective."

habit_strategy:
  principle: "Symptom Tracking for Dose Calibration"
  explanation: "A simple weekly log helps you and your clinician see patterns and fine-tune your dose accurately."
  example: "Every Sunday, note: hot flashes (how many?), sleep quality (1-10), mood, energy. Share at appointments."
  habit_tip: "📱 Set a weekly phone reminder: 'Sunday evening symptom check' — takes 2 minutes, guides better care."
