content_text: |
  That's such an important question 💜 — because hormone therapy isn't one-size-fits-all. The goal is to match the right woman, at the right time, with the right dose and route.
  
  ✅ Most likely to benefit: Women who are under 60 — or within about 10 years of their last period — and who are bothered by moderate to severe menopause symptoms such as hot flashes, sleep disruption, or vaginal dryness. MHT also helps protect bone and metabolic health if started in this 'window of opportunity.'
  
  ⚖️ You may still be a candidate if: You're older or more than 10 years post-menopause but otherwise healthy — in this case, a lower-dose transdermal plan and close monitoring are key.
  
  🚫 MHT is not recommended (or needs specialist supervision) if you have:
  • A current or recent estrogen-dependent cancer (like certain breast or uterine cancers)
  • Unexplained vaginal bleeding
  • Untreated high blood pressure
  • Active or past blood clots or stroke
  • Severe liver disease
  • Known clotting disorders (thrombophilia)
  • Uncontrolled heart disease
  
  In those cases, non-hormonal therapies can still manage symptoms safely 🌿.
  
  The safest modern options use transdermal 17β-estradiol plus micronized progesterone — body-identical, lowest risk, and personalized to your health profile.

action_tips:
  - "🌿 Check your window: If you're under 60 or within 10 years of menopause, discuss starting MHT soon — benefits are greatest then."
  - "🩺 Review your history: Bring a list of health issues and medications to your clinician before deciding."
  - "💬 Ask the right question: Instead of 'Is HRT safe?' ask 'Is HRT safe for me?' — that's where individualized care begins."

motivation_nudge: "You deserve to feel well — the key is finding a plan that fits your body, not fear or myths 💜."
