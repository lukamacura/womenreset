  Calm is chemistry 🌿. Practices like deep breathing, yoga, meditation, or prayer activate the vagus nerve — your body's built-in relaxation switch. This lowers cortisol, steadies heart rate, and boosts serotonin. Regular calm practice rewires your stress response and restores balance between hormones and emotions.

action_tips:
  - "🧘 Practice 10 minutes of slow breathing or yoga daily."
  - "🎵 Hum, sing, or pray — vibration activates the vagus nerve."
  - "📓 Journal a calming thought or gratitude note before bed."

motivation_nudge: "💜 Calm is a learned rhythm — every breath trains your hormones to follow your peace."
