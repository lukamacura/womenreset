content_text: |
  
  Waking between 2–4 a.m. is incredibly common in menopause. Your body isn't broken — it's reacting to hormone shifts that affect temperature, cortisol, and blood sugar. The key is to respond with calm instead of frustration.
  
  Here's **3 a.m. Calm Reset (6–8 minutes):**
  
  **Step 1 — Stay low and calm (1 min):**  
  Keep lights dim and repeat to yourself, *"This is temporary; my body is just resetting."*  
  → Reduces adrenaline.
  
  **Step 2 — Cooling breath (2 min):**  
  Place one hand on your chest. Inhale 4 sec → exhale 6–7 sec through pursed lips.  
  Use a cool pack on wrists or neck if needed.  
  → Lowers heart rate and temperature.
  
  **Step 3 — Ground the body (2 min):**  
  Gently press heels and fingertips into the mattress, noticing each contact point.  
  → Signals safety.
  
  **Step 4 — Guided micro-focus (1–3 min):**  
  Count slow breaths or visualize gentle waves.  
  → Redirects thoughts from worry to rhythm.
  
  Most women drift back to sleep within 5–10 minutes once the body cools and cortisol settles 🌙.
