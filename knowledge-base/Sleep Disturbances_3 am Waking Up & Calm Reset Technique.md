content_text: |
  Waking between 2–4 a.m. is incredibly common in menopause 💜. Your body isn’t broken — it’s reacting to hormone shifts that affect temperature, cortisol, and blood sugar. The key is to respond with calm instead of frustration.
  
  Here’s **3 a.m. Calm Reset (6–8 minutes):**
  
  **Step 1 – Stay low and calm (1 min):**  
  Keep lights dim and repeat to yourself, *“This is temporary; my body is just resetting.”*  
  → Reduces adrenaline.
  
  **Step 2 – Cooling breath (2 min):**  
  Place one hand on your chest. Inhale 4 sec → exhale 6–7 sec through pursed lips.  
  Use a cool pack on wrists or neck if needed.  
  → Lowers heart rate and temperature.
  
  **Step 3 – Ground the body (2 min):**  
  Gently press heels and fingertips into the mattress, noticing each contact point.  
  → Signals safety.
  
  **Step 4 – Guided micro-focus (1–3 min):**  
  Count slow breaths or visualize gentle waves.  
  → Redirects thoughts from worry to rhythm.
  
  Most women drift back to sleep within 5–10 minutes once the body cools and cortisol settles 🌙.

  - "🌬️ Use cooling tools: fan, light bedding, or cold pack at pulse points."
  - "⏰ Avoid clock-watching: it heightens alertness and anxiety."
  - "🪷 If awake >20 min: sit quietly and breathe until drowsy, then return to bed."
  - "🕯️ Repeat nightly: practicing the same calm flow shortens wake time over weeks."

motivation_nudge: "🌸 Night waking isn’t failure — it’s feedback. Respond gently, and your body learns safety faster each time."

habit_strategy:
  explanation: "Plan your calm response in advance so your body recognizes it as safety, not stress."
