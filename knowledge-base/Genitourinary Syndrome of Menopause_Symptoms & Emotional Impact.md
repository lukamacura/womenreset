  You’re definitely not alone 💜. GSM symptoms often show up as **dryness, burning, pain during intimacy, urinary urgency, or more frequent infections**. These physical changes can also affect how you feel — causing frustration, worry, or loss of confidence.

  The truth is: nothing about this is your fault, and everything about it is manageable 🌷. Relief and comfort are absolutely within reach.

action_tips:
  - "💧 Use **vaginal moisturizers** several times a week to relieve dryness and itching."
  - "❤️ Apply **lubricants before intimacy** — water or silicone-based options work best."
  - "🩺 Talk to your doctor if you experience spotting, pain, or recurring UTIs."

motivation_nudge: "🌿 You deserve comfort, closeness, and confidence — your body just needs gentle, consistent support."

follow_up_question: "Would you like to understand what causes this, explore non-hormonal and hormonal options, or understand how to heal after years of painful or difficult sex?"
