  Mornings can feel the toughest — but a few small rituals can change everything 🌅.
  When you wake, your joints are dehydrated and your circulation is slow. The goal isn't intensity — it's *activation*.
  Think of it as your gentle wake-up sequence: hydrate, move, breathe. Each signal tells your body, 'You're safe; it's time to flow again.' 💜

action_tips:
  - "💧 **Step 1 – Hydrate:** Drink a glass of water before coffee to re-lubricate joints."
  - "🧘‍♀️ **Step 2 – Mobility:** Try 5 minutes of stretches — shoulder rolls, hip circles, or cat-cow."
  - "🌞 **Step 3 – Activation:** Walk or stand in sunlight for circulation and mood."

motivation_nudge: "🌿 Every small morning habit whispers: *I'm caring for you now.*"

habit_strategy: |
  **Micro-Movement Momentum** — Tiny morning movements build consistency and reduce stiffness.
  
  Keep a yoga mat by your bed; stretch before checking your phone.
  
  🧘 **Tip:** Stack movement with automatic habits like boiling the kettle.
