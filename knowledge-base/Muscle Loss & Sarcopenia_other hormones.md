  The hormones that once helped you bounce back now take more coffee breaks than you do ☕💜.
  
  Growth hormone, testosterone, and DHEA all decline with age. That slows repair and protein synthesis. Add chronic stress and cortisol, and recovery drops further. The fix? Lift, rest, eat, repeat 🌿.

action_tips:
  - "🏋️ Lift weights 2–3× weekly to trigger anabolic hormones."
  - "🌙 Sleep 7–9 h — growth hormone peaks in deep sleep."
  - "🧘 Lower cortisol with breathwork or yoga."

motivation_nudge: "🧬 Exercise and rest are natural hormone therapy."

habit_strategy: |
  **Sleep–Strength Pairing** — Treat sleep and strength as equal pillars so recovery matches the work you do.
  
  After strength days, protect a consistent bedtime and aim for a solid wind-down so your body can rebuild.
  
  🌙 **Tip:** Put sleep on the calendar like workouts — same priority, same consistency.
