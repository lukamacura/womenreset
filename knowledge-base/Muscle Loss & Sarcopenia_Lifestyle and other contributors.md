  Everyday habits can quietly steal muscle 💜.
  
  When you move less, eat too little protein, or skimp on sleep, your body shifts into energy-saving mode. Chronic stress or dieting make it worse. The fix is nourishment, not punishment 🌿 — protein, movement, rest, repeat.

action_tips:
  - "🚶 Move every hour — micro-activity prevents atrophy."
  - "🍳 Eat 25–30 g protein per meal."
  - "🛌 Keep consistent bedtimes for recovery."

motivation_nudge: "🌼 Strength is built by repetition, not perfection."

  **Micro-Movement Routine** — Break sitting time with short activity bursts.
  
  Set hourly reminders for a 2-minute stretch.
  
  ⏰ **Tip:** “Move before scroll” keeps you consistent.
