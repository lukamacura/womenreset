  Let’s set your body up for success 🌞.

  A **warm-up** isn’t just a box to tick — it’s your way of waking up joints, muscles, and circulation before real work begins. For women in midlife, it’s especially important: it reduces stiffness, eases morning tightness, and lowers the risk of injury.

  Think of it as oiling your body’s gears before you drive — smooth, steady, and safe. Even 5 minutes of dynamic movement can make your workout feel lighter, stronger, and more confident.

action_tips:
  - "🔥 **Move Dynamically:** Spend 5–10 minutes with arm circles, marching, hip swings, and torso twists."
  - "🛡️ **Activate Muscles:** Wake up your glutes, core, and shoulders before lifting or cardio."
  - "⚡ **Mobilize First:** Try gentle ankle rolls, cat-cow stretches, or hip openers — it sharpens focus and stability."
  - "💧 **Warm from Inside:** Breathe deeper and move with intention — let warmth spread through your body."

motivation_nudge: "💛 Skipping warm-up is like asking your body to sprint before it’s awake — a few mindful minutes change everything."

habit_strategy: "Link your warm-up to a trigger — like putting on workout shoes or turning on music. Once it’s automatic, your body will crave the movement rhythm."

follow_up_question: "Would you like guidance on hydration and electrolytes for menopause training, or learn about the importance of cool-down?"
