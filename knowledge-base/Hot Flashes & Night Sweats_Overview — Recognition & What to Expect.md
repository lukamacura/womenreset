  Those sudden waves of heat can feel overwhelming 💜. **Hot flashes** are brief surges of warmth, often followed by **sweating, chills, or a racing heartbeat**. At night, they may interrupt rest — that's when they're called **night sweats** 🌙.

  Most women experience them during perimenopause and the first few years of postmenopause. They can last seconds to minutes, happen multiple times daily, or appear sporadically. You're not doing anything wrong — your body is adapting to hormonal changes 🌿.

action_tips:
  - "📋 Learn to recognize your body's early warning signs: warmth in chest, neck tension, or subtle sweating before a full flash."
  - "🕐 Notice when they happen most: morning, evening, after meals, during stress, or randomly throughout the day."
  - "📖 Understand the typical timeline: most intense in perimenopause, gradually improving 3-5 years post-menopause for most women."
  - "💬 Learn the difference: hot flashes (daytime) vs night sweats (sleep disruption) require different management strategies."
  - "🩺 Identify severity: mild (noticeable warmth), moderate (sweating, need to cool down), severe (drenching, multiple daily, sleep disruption)."

motivation_nudge: "🌸 Understanding what's normal helps you respond calmly — knowledge replaces fear with empowerment."
