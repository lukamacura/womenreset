  Stress really does make weight loss harder.
  
  When hormones fluctuate, cortisol — your stress hormone — rises more easily and stays high longer. **Chronically elevated cortisol tells your body to conserve energy and store fat, especially around the belly.**
  
  It's not about willpower — it's about safety. Your body holds on when it feels under threat. Calm practices, deep rest, and steady routines remind your system that it's safe to release again 🌿.

action_tips:
  - "🧘 Practice daily relaxation — yoga, breathwork, or meditation signal your body to switch off stress mode."
  - "☕ Limit caffeine and alcohol — both raise cortisol and disturb sleep."
  - "😴 Aim for 7–9 hours of restorative sleep — it's your built-in hormone reset."
  - "🌿 Add slow movement like walking or stretching to balance your nervous system."
  - "📓 Journaling before bed can help quiet racing thoughts and improve rest."

motivation_nudge: "🌿 You can't burn fat in fight-or-flight — calm is your real fat-burning mode."
