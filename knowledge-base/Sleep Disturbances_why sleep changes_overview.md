content_text: |
  Many women notice their once-steady sleep becomes unpredictable.
  
  As estrogen and progesterone fall, your brain’s sleep center grows more sensitive to stress, light, and temperature. Melatonin production drops while cortisol often stays higher for longer, making it easier to wake at 3 a.m. or feel alert right when you want to rest.
  
  This isn’t a sign your body is broken — it’s recalibrating. Poor sleep ripples through everything: mood, metabolism, energy, and even hormone balance. But the encouraging truth is that *sleep can be retrained*. With light, rhythm, and calm routines, you can teach your body to rest again one layer at a time 🌙.

  - "💡 Track patterns: Note what happens before and during restless nights — hormones and habits leave clues."
  - "🌅 Get morning sunlight: Ten minutes of daylight resets your internal clock and steadies cortisol."
  - "💧 Balance basics: Hydration, steady meals, and gentle movement all support your nervous system and sleep quality."

motivation_nudge: "🌸 Your body isn’t failing — it’s learning a new rhythm. With awareness and consistency, deep rest returns."
