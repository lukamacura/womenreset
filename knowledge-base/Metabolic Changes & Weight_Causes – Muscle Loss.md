  Losing muscle after menopause is incredibly common — but it's *not* inevitable 💪.
  
  Sarcopenia — age-related muscle loss — accelerates significantly during the menopausal transition, but understanding why puts you in the driver's seat.
  
  Estrogen isn't just a reproductive hormone; it's profoundly anabolic, supporting muscle protein synthesis and protecting against muscle breakdown. As levels decline, you lose approximately 3-8% of muscle mass per decade after age 30, with losses accelerating post-menopause.
  
  This matters beyond aesthetics. Muscle is your most metabolically active tissue — it burns calories at rest, regulates blood sugar, supports bone density, and maintains functional independence. Losing muscle means:
  
  • Reduced resting metabolic rate (fewer calories burned daily)
  • Decreased insulin sensitivity and glucose regulation
  • Lower strength and increased fall risk
  • Reduced capacity for activities you love
  
  Here's what the research is crystal clear about: **progressive resistance training 2-3 times weekly plus adequate protein intake (1.2-1.6g per kg body weight) can prevent and even reverse this loss**. 
  
  Without resistance training and enough protein, this process accelerates — leaving you feeling weaker, softer, and more fatigued. The solution is **movement, nourishment, and strength** — not restriction 🌿.
 
  Your muscles are waiting to respond — they just need the right stimulus and fuel.

action_tips:
  - "🏋️ Strength train 2–3× per week — use bands, dumbbells, or your own body weight."
  - "🍳 Eat 100–150 g of protein daily (~30 g per meal) to preserve muscle and balance blood sugar."
  - "🥦 Add fiber and colorful plants to reduce inflammation and support recovery."
  - "😴 Sleep 7–8 hours — muscle repair happens overnight."
  - "💊 Consider creatine (3–5 g daily) to boost strength and energy, if approved by your clinician."

motivation_nudge: "💪 Every rep is a deposit in your future independence — strong is your new steady."

habit_strategy: |
  **Muscle Memory Habit Loop** — Pairing short, consistent strength sessions with protein-rich meals signals your body to grow stronger again.
  
  After breakfast, do a 10-minute band workout — then refuel with a protein shake.
  
  🌸 **Tip:** Strength grows from repetition, not perfection. Even 10 minutes counts.
