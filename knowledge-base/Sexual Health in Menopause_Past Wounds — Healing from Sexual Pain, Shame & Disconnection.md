content_text: |
  Feeling ashamed, broken, or distant is common — and untrue 💜. If you've experienced months or years of painful sex, loss of desire, or emotional disconnection, healing takes intentional repair work. Menopause invites a redefinition of sexuality, not an ending. Connection returns through kindness, honest conversation about past hurts, and low-pressure touch. Confidence grows when you address what happened, not just what's happening now.

action_tips:
  - "✍️ Write a private letter acknowledging your sexual journey — what hurt, what was lost, what you grieve, and what you hope for."
  - "💬 Have one 'repair conversation' with your partner using this script: 'When we stopped being intimate, I felt ___. What I needed then was ___. What I need now is ___.'"
  - "🛋️ Attend 3-6 couples therapy sessions specifically focused on sexual reconnection and healing past patterns."
  - "🤲 Practice 'skin hunger' healing: 10 minutes of clothed, nonsexual cuddling daily for 3 weeks to rebuild touch safety."
  - "📖 Journal weekly on this prompt: 'What story am I telling myself about my sexuality, and is it true?'"
