  Screens and bright lights at night really do keep your brain awake 💡.
  
  Your sleep switch depends on darkness. Blue light from phones, TVs, and LEDs suppresses **melatonin**, the hormone that signals ‘time to rest.’ When melatonin release is delayed, your brain stays alert and sleep feels far away.
  
  Creating a dim, warm-light environment in the evening tells your body it’s safe to unwind. Think candlelight, not daylight 🌙. The softer your surroundings get after sunset, the faster your nervous system slips into calm mode.

action_tips:
  - "📵 **Dim or power down screens** at least 60 minutes before bed."
  - "💡 **Use amber or red lights** after sunset — skip bright white or blue bulbs."
  - "👓 **Try blue-light glasses** if screens are unavoidable in the evening."
  - "📺 **Keep devices out of the bedroom** whenever possible."
  - "🕯️ **Switch to warm lamps or candles** to cue your body it’s nighttime."

motivation_nudge: "🌸 Dimming your world after sunset is a love letter to your hormones — it’s how your body remembers peace."
