  Midlife metabolism thrives on nourishment, not restriction 💜.
  
  Your body now responds best to *stable blood sugar*, *strong muscles*, and calm hormones — and food is the foundation. Forget 'less food' — think *better fuel*.
  
  Each meal should have:
  • **Protein** (25–30 g) to steady appetite and protect muscle.
  • **Fiber & colorful plants** to balance blood sugar and feed gut health.
  • **Healthy fats** to support hormones and satisfaction.
  
  When you eat enough, your body feels safe to release stored energy 🌿.

action_tips:
  - "🍳 Start your day with protein — eggs, Greek yogurt, or tofu (25–30 g)."
  - "🥗 Fill half your plate with colorful veggies and fiber-rich carbs."
  - "🧋 Add omega-3 fats (avocado, nuts, olive oil) for hormone support."
  - "💧 Drink water before meals — hydration helps digestion and energy."
  - "🚫 Skip extreme diets — they lower metabolism and raise cortisol."

motivation_nudge: "🌸 You don't need to eat less — you need to eat *smarter*. Nourish your metabolism and it will start working *with* you again."

habit_strategy: |
  **Nourish-to-Burn Framework** — Eating balanced, protein-rich meals three times a day steadies hormones and restores metabolic flexibility.
  
  Build each meal with ⅓ protein, ⅓ colorful carbs, and ⅓ healthy fats — no counting, just balance.
  
  🌿 **Tip:** Consistency beats perfection — one balanced plate at a time.
