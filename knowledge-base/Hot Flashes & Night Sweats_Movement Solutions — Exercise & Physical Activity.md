  Movement is one of your best regulators 🌸. Regular **aerobic and strength training** can reduce hot flashes by up to **50%**, balance hormones, and calm the nervous system.

  Exercise improves **sleep quality**, reduces **stress-related temperature spikes**, and builds resilience 💪. You don't need intense workouts — gentle, consistent movement teaches your body to regulate temperature efficiently over time.

action_tips:
  - "🚶‍♀️ Complete 150 minutes weekly of moderate aerobic activity: brisk walking, cycling, swimming (30 min x 5 days or 50 min x 3 days)."
  - "🏋️ Add 2 resistance training sessions weekly: bodyweight exercises, weights, or bands for 20-30 minutes targeting major muscle groups."
  - "🧘‍♀️ Practice 15-20 minutes of restorative yoga or gentle stretching before bed to activate parasympathetic nervous system."
  - "⏰ Time exercise strategically: avoid intense workouts 3-4 hours before bed; morning or early afternoon exercise improves nighttime temperature regulation."
  - "🌡️ Exercise in cool environments when possible: temperature-controlled gym, shaded outdoor paths, or early morning/evening workouts."

motivation_nudge: "💪 Movement is medicine — each workout strengthens your body's temperature control system and reduces stress-triggered flashes."

habit_strategy: |
  **Movement Anchoring** — Linking exercise to existing daily routines creates automatic consistency and builds thermoregulatory adaptation.
  
  Walk 25 minutes immediately after lunch every workday — habit cue (lunch) triggers movement automatically.
  
  🎧 **Tip:** Create a “movement playlist” that signals your brain it's exercise time — music becomes a powerful trigger.
