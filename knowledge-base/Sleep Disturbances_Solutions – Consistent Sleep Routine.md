  Your sleep clock loves rhythm 🌅. The more consistent your schedule, the more stable your hormones and energy become.
  
  When you go to bed and wake up at roughly the same time — even on weekends — your brain learns exactly when to start melatonin and when to lift cortisol. In menopause, this rhythm often drifts, causing unpredictable nights and groggy mornings.
  
  The fix isn’t complicated: consistency, daylight in the morning, and calm cues in the evening. Think of it as *training your body like a rhythm instrument* — gentle repetition brings harmony again 💜.

action_tips:
  - "⏰ **Set a fixed bedtime and wake-up time** — keep it within a 30-minute range daily."
  - "🌅 **Get morning light exposure** soon after waking to lock in your body clock."
  - "🕯️ Use evening cues: dim lights, calming rituals, and low stimulation."
  - "😴 **Avoid long naps** after 3 p.m. to protect nighttime sleep drive."
  - "📆 **Stay consistent on weekends** — rhythm matters more than perfection."

motivation_nudge: "🌸 Every consistent night is a vote for calmer hormones and steadier energy — progress happens quietly, one rhythm at a time."
