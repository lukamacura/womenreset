 Sleep tracking isn't about control — it's about awareness 💜. When you note when you wake, how you feel, and what happened that day, patterns start to appear. You might discover that caffeine after 2pm, late meals, or stressful conversations are the real culprits.

 **A word about wearables:** Devices like Oura, Fitbit, or Apple Watch can be helpful, but they're not perfect. If the data doesn't match how you feel, trust your body. The goal isn't perfect numbers—it's understanding your unique patterns.

 **Beyond data:** Practices like **mindfulness**, **breathwork**, or brief evening reflection lower stress and train your brain to feel safe again. You don't need perfection—just curiosity. 

 Awareness transforms "Why can't I sleep?" into "Now I understand what my body needs." 🌙

action_tips:
  - "📓 **Keep a simple sleep journal** — note bedtime, wake time, and one factor from that day."
  - "💭 **Track how you FEEL**, not just numbers — your experience matters more than data."
  - "🔍 **Look for patterns over 2+ weeks** — one bad night doesn't reveal much."
  - "📱 **Use wearables if they help** — but skip them if they create pressure or anxiety."
  - "🪷 **Reflect weekly** — which small change improved your rest most?"

motivation_nudge: "🌸 Awareness builds calm — every observation is a gentle step toward confidence and deeper rest."
