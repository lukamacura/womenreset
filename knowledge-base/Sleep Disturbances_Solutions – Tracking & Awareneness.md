  Sleep tracking isn’t about control — it’s about awareness 💜. When you note when you wake, how you feel, and what happened that day, patterns start to appear. You might see that caffeine, late meals, or stress spikes are the real culprits.
  
  Practices like **mindfulness**, **breathwork**, or even short reflection at night lower cortisol and train your brain to feel safe again. You don’t need perfection — just curiosity. Awareness transforms “Why can’t I sleep?” into “Now I understand what my body needs.” 🌙

action_tips:
  - "📓 **Keep a short sleep journal** — note bedtime, wake time, and one feeling or event that day."
  - "🌬️ **Use the 4-7-8 breathing pattern** to slow your heart rate before bed."
  - "🤝 **Share progress** with a friend or group for support and motivation."
  - "📱 **Try wearables** if they feel helpful, but skip them if they create pressure."
  - "🪷 **Reflect weekly** — what small habits improved your rest most?"

motivation_nudge: "🌸 Awareness builds calm — every observation is a gentle step toward confidence and deeper rest."
