content_text: |
  Many women notice their once-steady sleep becomes unpredictable.
  
  As estrogen and progesterone fall, your body's temperature regulation becomes erratic, and the chemical signals that deepen sleep weaken. Melatonin production drops while cortisol often stays elevated, making it easier to wake at 3 a.m. or feel alert right when you want to rest. And because estrogen helps keep blood sugar stable, its decline can trigger nighttime insulin spikes followed by crashes—waking you with a racing heart or that wired-but-tired feeling.
  
  This isn’t a sign your body is broken — it’s recalibrating. Poor sleep ripples through everything: mood, metabolism, energy, and even hormone balance. But the encouraging truth is that *sleep can be restored*. With steady light exposure, balanced evening meals, and calm routines, you can guide your body back to rest, one layer at a time 🌙.

action_tips:
  - "💡 Track patterns: Note what happens before and during restless nights — hormones and habits leave clues."
  - "🌅 Get morning sunlight: Ten minutes of daylight resets your internal clock and steadies cortisol."
  - "🍽️ Stabilize evening blood sugar: Eat a protein-rich dinner with healthy fats, limit refined carbs at night, and try a small protein/fat snack before bed (like nuts or cheese) to prevent 3 a.m. wake-ups."
  - "💧 Balance basics: Hydration, steady meals, and gentle movement all support your nervous system and sleep quality."

motivation_nudge: "🌸 Your body isn’t failing — it’s learning a new rhythm. With awareness and consistency, deep rest returns."
