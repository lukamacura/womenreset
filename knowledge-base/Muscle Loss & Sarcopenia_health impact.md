  Muscle loss doesn't just change how you look — it fundamentally changes how you live 💜.
  
  Muscle is your most metabolically active tissue, and losing it has cascading effects:
  
  • **Metabolic:** Reduced resting metabolic rate and fewer calories burned daily
  • **Blood sugar:** Decreased insulin sensitivity and glucose regulation
  • **Physical function:** Lower strength, increased fall risk, and reduced capacity for activities you love
  • **Bone health:** Less mechanical stress to maintain bone density
  
  This matters beyond aesthetics — it's about maintaining your independence, energy, and quality of life for decades to come.
  
action_tips:
  - "🧘 Practice balance daily (yoga or tai chi)."
  - "🏋️ Lift weights 2–3× per week."
  - "🚶 Keep moving through the day."

motivation_nudge: "🔥 Muscle is your longevity organ — strong muscles mean a strong future."

habit_strategy: |
  **Balance Integration** — Tiny balance drills prevent falls.
  
  Stand on one leg while brushing teeth.
  
  🧍‍♀️ **Tip:** Two minutes daily = better stability.

follow_up_question: "Would you like to explore exercise and resistance training to rebuild muscle, learn nutrition strategies to support muscle retention and growth, or understand recovery and hormonal support that help your body hold onto muscle?"
