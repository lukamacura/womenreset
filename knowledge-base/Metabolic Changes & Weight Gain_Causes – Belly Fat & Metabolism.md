  As estrogen dips, fat decides to relocate — from hips and thighs straight to the belly (rude, right?). This shift favors visceral fat, the deeper kind which wraps around internal organs.
  
  This isn't just cosmetic. Visceral fat is metabolically active tissue that increases inflammation, disrupts insulin sensitivity, and raises cardiovascular risk. Meanwhile, declining estrogen also reduces your resting metabolic rate by approximately 200-300 calories per day, making weight management more challenging.
  
  The good news? You can absolutely turn this around with strength training, protein-rich meals, and stress balance 🌿.

action_tips:
  - "🍳 Eat 30 g protein per meal — your cornerstone for muscle and metabolic support."
  - "🥗 Swap refined carbs for vegetables, lentils, and whole grains to steady blood sugar."
  - "🏋️ Do resistance training 2–3× weekly — it rebuilds lean tissue and signals fat to burn."
  - "🌿 Lower stress load — cortisol drives belly fat; try slow walks or breathwork daily."

motivation_nudge: "🌸 A stronger core starts with balanced hormones, not endless crunches — progress comes from nourishment and calm."

habit_strategy: |
  **Core Confidence Loop** — Pairing daily movement with balanced meals builds metabolic stability and reshapes body composition over time.
  
  Start each day with protein and a 10-minute walk — your simplest formula for rebalancing hormones and reducing belly fat.
  
  🔥 **Tip:** Consistency beats intensity — gentle daily effort shifts belly fat faster than sporadic diets or workouts.
