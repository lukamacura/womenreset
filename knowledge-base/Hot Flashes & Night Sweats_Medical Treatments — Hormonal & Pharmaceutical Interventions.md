  It's reassuring to know there are many effective treatments 💜. **Menopausal Hormone Therapy (MHT)** remains the most powerful — reducing hot flashes by **75-90%**, improving mood, sleep, and energy.

  If hormones aren't right for you, non-hormonal options like **SSRIs/SNRIs**, **gabapentin**, **fezolinetant (Veozah)**, **CBT**, or **acupuncture** can also bring significant relief 🌿.

  Every woman's body is unique — the goal is not perfection, but comfort and quality of life through informed medical choice.

action_tips:
  - "💊 Discuss MHT with a menopause specialist: transdermal estradiol (patch/gel) + micronized progesterone often has best safety/efficacy profile."
  - "📋 If MHT is contraindicated, ask about: paroxetine 7.5mg, venlafaxine 75mg, gabapentin 300-900mg, or fezolinetant 45mg daily."
  - "🩺 Request a comprehensive health assessment before starting: breast/uterine health, cardiovascular risk, thrombosis risk, liver function."
  - "📅 Track symptoms weekly using a validated scale (like MRS or Greene) to objectively measure treatment response."
  - "🔄 Plan 3-month follow-up to assess efficacy and adjust: most treatments show full benefit by 4-8 weeks, allow adequate trial period."

motivation_nudge: "✨ You have multiple safe, evidence-based paths to relief — medical treatment isn't giving up, it's choosing quality of life."
