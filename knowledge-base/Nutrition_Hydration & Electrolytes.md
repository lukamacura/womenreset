  If you’re suddenly thirstier or waking up dry — it’s not just you 🌸. Hormonal changes can make fluid balance tricky.

  Aim for **2–3 liters daily** from water, herbal teas, and hydrating foods (like cucumber, soups, and berries). Electrolytes help replace minerals lost from sweat or hot flashes 💧.

  Too much caffeine or alcohol can worsen dehydration and sleep — think ‘balance,’ not ‘ban.’

action_tips:
  - "💧 Drink 8–10 cups of water daily — more if active or in heat."
  - "🥒 Eat water-rich foods (melon, citrus, cucumber)."
  - "🧂 Add electrolytes after sweating or night sweats."
  - "🌿 Swap one coffee for herbal tea to improve hydration."

habit_strategy: |
  **Hydration Anchors** — Pairing water with existing routines makes it effortless.
  
  Drink a glass after brushing teeth or before each meal.
  
  🍽️ **Tip:** Keep a water bottle visible — reminders work better than willpower.

motivation_nudge: "🌸 Every sip of water is a small act of self-care — cooling, cleansing, and calming."
