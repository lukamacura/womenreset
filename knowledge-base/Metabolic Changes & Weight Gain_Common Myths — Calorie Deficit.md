content_text: |
  During menopause, the old 'calories in, calories out' model stops working the same way. As estrogen declines, your body can burn and store energy differently — with less muscle, a lower daily energy burn, and reduced insulin sensitivity.
  
  So even if you're eating less, your body may be holding on to fat because it feels under stress — not because you're failing. The goal now is to build trust with your metabolism again: strength training, balanced meals, and recovery all help reset that safety signal 🌿.

action_tips:
  - "🏋️ Focus on maintaining or building muscle — it's your metabolic powerhouse."
  - "🥗 Eat enough protein and fiber to steady blood sugar and prevent cravings."
  - "😴 Prioritize rest and stress recovery — chronic stress keeps fat locked in."
  - "💧 Stay hydrated and avoid overly restrictive diets that slow metabolism."

motivation_nudge: "🌸 You're not broken — your metabolism is protecting you. Once it feels safe again, weight loss becomes possible."
