## Common Sleep Issues

- Difficulty falling asleep
- Frequent waking during the night
- Night sweats disrupting sleep
- Early morning waking
- Restless sleep
- Feeling unrefreshed upon waking

## Causes

- Declining estrogen levels affecting body temperature regulation
- Night sweats causing discomfort
- Anxiety and mood changes
- Increased need to urinate
- Restless leg syndrome (more common during menopause)

## Sleep Hygiene Practices

### Environment
- Keep bedroom temperature cool (65-68°F)
- Use breathable, moisture-wicking bedding
- Ensure complete darkness
- Reduce noise with earplugs or white noise
- Reserve bedroom for sleep and intimacy only

- Maintain a consistent sleep schedule (even on weekends)
- Establish a relaxing bedtime routine
- Avoid screens 1-2 hours before bed
- Limit caffeine after noon
- Avoid alcohol close to bedtime
- Exercise regularly, but not too close to bedtime

### Lifestyle
- Limit large meals before bed

- Consider meditation or gentle yoga
- Keep a sleep diary to identify patterns

## Treatment Options
