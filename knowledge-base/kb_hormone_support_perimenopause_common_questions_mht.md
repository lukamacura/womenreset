  Menopausal Hormone Therapy (MHT) replaces the estrogen and progesterone that naturally decline at midlife. It's the most effective treatment for hot flashes, night sweats, brain fog, sleep problems, mood changes, and vaginal dryness.
  
  For most healthy women younger than 60 or within ten years of their final period, the benefits generally outweigh the risks. The safest forms are transdermal estrogen (patch, gel, or spray) and micronized progesterone if you have a uterus.
  
  Beginning treatment around the menopausal transition may help protect your bones, heart, brain, and muscle health — always under medical supervision.

action_tips:
  - "💬 Talk to a menopause-trained clinician — not all doctors specialize in MHT."
  - "🌸 Ask about transdermal estrogen + micronized progesterone, and low-dose testosterone if you struggle with libido or energy."
  - "🩷 Review annually with your provider; dosage may change as your body adapts."
  - "🧘 Combine MHT with lifestyle medicine: anti-inflammatory food, exercise, sleep, stress care."

motivation_nudge: "✨ This isn't vanity therapy — it's vitality therapy. Replacing what's missing helps protect your future health, not chase your youth 🌿."

habit_strategy:
  principle: "Symptom & Mood Tracking"
  explanation: "Keeping a short weekly log helps you and your clinician tailor hormones more accurately."
  example: "Note how you sleep, think, and feel over the first 6–8 weeks — then discuss trends at review."
  habit_tip: "Pair reflection with your Sunday routine — it keeps you aware of subtle improvements."
