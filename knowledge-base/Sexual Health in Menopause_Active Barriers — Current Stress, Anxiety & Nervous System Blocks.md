  When desire fades, it's rarely just hormones — it's your body and brain asking for safety and connection 💜. Stress, resentment, or worry can mute mental arousal as much as low estrogen dulls physical sensitivity. Your nervous system needs to feel safe RIGHT NOW to allow arousal. Balance is rebuildable: calm the nervous system, restore rest, and add curiosity and novelty. Hormonal support can help; emotional safety sustains desire.

action_tips:
  - "🫁 Practice 4-7-8 breathing (4 count in, 7 hold, 8 out) before any intimate touch to signal safety to your nervous system."
  - "🛡️ Create a 'pause word' with your partner to stop immediately when anxiety or discomfort spikes during intimacy — no questions, no pressure."
  - "⏰ Try intimacy when stress is naturally lower — late evening after winding down, or slow weekend mornings."
  - "🎯 Notice what's weighing on you right now (work, kids, money, health) — even naming stressors can reduce their grip on your body."
  - "🚫 Remove performance goals entirely for 2-4 weeks; focus only on relaxed touch, presence, and what feels good."

  💬 Arousal starts in the mind — calm creates connection.  
  
habit_strategy: |
  **Nervous System Reset** — Daily nervous system regulation creates the physiological foundation for desire. Your body needs to feel safe before it can experience arousal — this isn't about “getting in the mood,” it's about building capacity.
  
  Each evening, practice 5 minutes of legs-up-the-wall breathing: lie on your back with legs elevated against a wall, one hand on your heart and one on your belly, breathing slowly while noticing the rise and fall. Do this whether or not intimacy is on the horizon.
  
  🕊️ **Tip:** Regulation is self-care, not foreplay. Build the foundation daily, and desire has room to emerge naturally.
