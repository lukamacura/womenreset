  Menopausal Hormone Therapy (MHT) isn't one-size-fits-all 💜. Every woman's biology, history, and goals are unique — so your dose, formulation, and duration should be too.
  
  **Finding Your Right Dose**
  The safest approach is to start with the lowest effective dose that relieves symptoms and protects long-term health. There's no universal 'standard' dose of estrogen, progesterone, or testosterone — your ideal range depends on your age, health, and how your body responds. As your body adapts, your clinician may fine-tune your estrogen–progesterone balance for best results.
  
  **Duration That Works for You**
  How long you stay on MHT depends on your needs: some women use it for a few years to calm hot flashes or sleep issues, while others continue longer for bone, brain, or heart benefits. There's no universal 'expiration date' — what matters is safety, symptom control, and how you feel.
  
  **Why Medical Supervision Matters**
  Hormone therapy works best — and safest — when guided by expert eyes. A menopause-trained clinician monitors your symptoms, adjusts doses, and keeps therapy within a safe, effective range through ongoing check-ins. Self-adjusting or ordering hormones online can be risky — product quality and dosing are often unreliable.

action_tips:
  - "🩺 Partner with a menopause-trained clinician: Schedule regular check-ins every 6–12 months to review symptoms, side effects, and lab results."
  - "🧬 Start low and go slow: Begin with the lowest effective dose — small adjustments can make big differences."
  - "📓 Track your response: Keep a simple log of mood, sleep, energy, and hot flashes to guide dose adjustments."
  - "🌙 Reevaluate yearly: Your hormone needs evolve as your body adapts and natural estrogen stabilizes."
  - "💗 Balance benefits and comfort: Continue therapy as long as it improves your quality of life and remains safe under supervision."
  - "⚠️ Avoid self-medicating: Don't adjust doses on your own or order hormones online without medical guidance — quality and safety can't be guaranteed."

motivation_nudge: "🌸 Personalized therapy is power — your plan should fit you, not a chart. It's not about being on hormones forever; it's about feeling well for as long as it serves your body."
