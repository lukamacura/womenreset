  Your body loves rhythm more than perfection 🌿. A gentle flow through your day keeps inflammation quiet and joints flexible.
  Think: **wake, nourish, move, recover.** Each phase tells your body it's supported and steady 💜.

action_tips:
  - "🌅 **Morning:** Hydrate and stretch for 5 minutes in sunlight."
  - "🥗 **Midday:** Eat protein + fiber + healthy fats; walk after meals."
  - "💻 **Afternoon:** Move for 2 minutes hourly to prevent stiffness."
  - "🌇 **Evening:** Limit screens; stretch or journal to lower cortisol."
  - "🌙 **Night:** Sleep 7–8 hours — your deepest anti-inflammatory therapy."

motivation_nudge: "✨ Progress is consistency, not perfection — each small rhythm shift heals you."
