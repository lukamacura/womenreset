content_text: |
  That feeling of being both wired and tired is so common in midlife 💜. Estrogen usually keeps cortisol — your stress hormone — balanced, while supporting serotonin and dopamine for mood and motivation. When estrogen dips, cortisol spikes more easily, and serotonin drops — making stress feel sharper and recovery slower. This hormonal dialogue explains why midlife can feel both wired and tired. The goal isn't zero stress but faster recovery 🌿.

action_tips:
  - "🧘‍♀️ Try slow breathing or meditation to engage your calm system."
  - "🚶‍♀️ Gentle movement — walks, stretching, yoga — lowers cortisol naturally."
  - "🍽️ Eat balanced meals with protein and fiber to prevent stress crashes."

motivation_nudge: "💜 Your stress system isn't broken — it's adapting to new hormone rhythms."

follow_up_question: "Would you like to explore mind-body practices to rebalance your stress response, learn emotional regulation tools that can help, or understand how sleep and cortisol interact in this loop?"
