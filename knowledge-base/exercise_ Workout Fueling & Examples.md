  So many women in midlife wonder what — and when — to eat around workouts 💜.

  Think of fueling as **priming and repairing your body’s engine**. Before exercise, a light mix of **carbs + protein** gives energy and protects muscle. After training, **protein is your repair signal** and carbs help restock glycogen and calm cortisol.

  Hydration with **electrolytes** supports recovery and mood — especially during perimenopause, when sweat and sodium losses rise.

  👉 Fasted workouts may sound efficient, but in midlife they can backfire by raising cortisol and slowing recovery. A few bites of fuel are far better than running on empty.

action_tips:
  - "🥑 Keep one go-to snack ready before workouts — routine builds consistency."
  - "🍲 Always pair protein + carbs after training for recovery and hormone balance."
  - "💧 Sip electrolytes during longer sessions or in hot weather — especially if you feel lightheaded or sluggish."

habit_strategy: "Prep one pre-workout and one post-workout combo you genuinely like. Once they’re automatic, fueling becomes effortless and sustainable."

motivation_nudge: "🌸 Food isn’t a reward — it’s your recovery partner. Every balanced meal makes your next workout stronger."
