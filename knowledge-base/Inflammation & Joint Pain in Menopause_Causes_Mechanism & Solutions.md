  Over 70% of women feel new or worsening joint aches during menopause.
  When estrogen drops, your body loses one of its natural anti-inflammatory shields. This shift — called *inflammaging* — makes tissues more sensitive and slows cartilage repair.
  Morning stiffness and tenderness aren't signs of weakness — they're signs your body is recalibrating 🌿.

action_tips:
  - "🥗 Eat Mediterranean-style: colorful plants, omega-3s, and lean proteins."
  - "💪 Move daily with low-impact strength and mobility exercises."
  - "🌞 Maintain vitamin D and hydration for joint health."
  - "😴 Protect your sleep and lower stress to calm inflammation."

motivation_nudge: "✨ You're not fragile — your body just needs steady movement, nourishment, and rest."

habit_strategy: |
  **Inflammation Awareness Loop** — Linking how you feel to what you do builds awareness and prevents flare-ups.
  
  If mornings feel stiff, stretch for 5 minutes before coffee.
  
  🌿 **Tip:** Pair gentle mobility or breathwork with your morning routine.

follow_up_question: "What would you like to learn next: a full daily flow to lower inflammation, a simple morning routine to start calm and steady, or a workday flow (breaks, meals, movement) to keep inflammation from building up?"
