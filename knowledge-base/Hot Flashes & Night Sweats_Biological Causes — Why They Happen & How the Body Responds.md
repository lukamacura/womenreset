  Here's what's really happening inside 🌿. As **estrogen levels fall**, they influence the **hypothalamus** — the brain's internal thermostat that keeps your body temperature steady. The loss of estrogen narrows your comfort zone (called the thermoneutral zone), so even a tiny rise in heat or stress can trigger a full hot flash 🌡️.

  When that happens, your brain signals your blood vessels to **dilate**, sending heat to the skin and causing **sweating, redness, and a racing heartbeat**. Once your body cools, you may even feel a quick chill afterward. **Neurotransmitters like serotonin and norepinephrine** also play key roles in this temperature sensitivity.

  It's not dangerous — it's your body learning a new hormonal balance 💜.

action_tips:
  - "📊 Use a 3-column log for 1 week: Time | Activity/Food/Stressor | Intensity (1-10) to map your biological triggers."
  - "🧬 Understand your hormonal stage: perimenopause (fluctuating) has more unpredictable flashes than postmenopause (low but stable)."
  - "🧠 Learn which neurotransmitters are involved: serotonin (mood/temperature link), norepinephrine (stress response), both affected by estrogen loss."
  - "⚖️ Recognize that your thermoneutral zone has narrowed from ~4°C to ~0°C — meaning tiny temperature changes trigger big responses."
  - "🔬 Track whether stress, exercise, or heat exposure triggers flashes — this reveals your autonomic nervous system sensitivity."

motivation_nudge: "💜 You're not broken — your thermostat is just recalibrating to new hormone levels. Understanding WHY helps you work WITH your body."

habit_strategy: |
  **Mechanism Mapping** — Understanding the biological cause helps you target interventions at the right pathway (hormonal, neural, or vascular).
  
  When a flash starts, think: “My hypothalamus detected a tiny change and overreacted — I can help it recalibrate.”
  
  🔍 **Tip:** Knowledge reduces fear — understanding the mechanism makes symptoms feel less mysterious and more manageable.
