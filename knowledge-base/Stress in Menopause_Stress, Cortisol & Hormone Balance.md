  Chronic stress keeps cortisol high — and that throws other hormones off balance 🌿.

  When cortisol dominates, estrogen and progesterone drop further. The result: belly fat, inflammation, sleep problems, and stronger hot flashes. Because estrogen used to buffer cortisol, stress feels sharper now.

  You don't need zero stress — just faster recovery. Think: short spikes, long calm periods 💗.

action_tips:
  - "🫁 Practice 4-7-8 breathing — inhale 4 s, hold 7 s, exhale 8 s, five rounds before bed."
  - "☀️ Get outside daily — sunlight and fresh air lower cortisol naturally."
  - "🧘 Do gentle yoga, stretching, or prayer to reset your nervous system."
  - "🥗 Stabilize blood sugar with protein and fiber at every meal."
  - "❤️ Spend time with people who soothe, not spike, your stress."

motivation_nudge: "💜 You're not overreacting — your nervous system is overworked. Calm is a skill you can rebuild anytime."
