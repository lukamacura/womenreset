  Women lose about 3–8 % of muscle per decade after 30, but once estrogen drops, that decline speeds up. The upside? Muscle loves a comeback story. Strength training, protein, and recovery flip the script fast 🌿.

action_tips:
  - "📏 Track grip strength or body composition every few months."
  - "🏋️ Begin resistance training early in menopause."
  - "🥚 Eat 25–30 g protein per meal."

motivation_nudge: "⏳ It's never too late — every lift rewinds biological age."
