  Food really can be medicine 🌿. A **Mediterranean-style diet** rich in **soy, flaxseeds, legumes, and healthy fats** helps balance hormones and reduce hot flashes for many women.

  **Omega-3s, magnesium, vitamin E, and black cohosh** may also support symptom relief — but responses vary. Always check supplement safety with your clinician 💊.

  Think of it as nourishment, not restriction — every balanced meal cools your system and steadies energy 💜.

action_tips:
  - "🥗 Build each meal around: leafy greens, beans/legumes, berries, olive oil, and fatty fish (salmon, sardines)."
  - "🥢 Add 1-2 servings daily of soy foods (tofu, tempeh, edamame) or ground flaxseed (1-2 tablespoons) for phytoestrogen support."
  - "💊 If supplementing, use evidence-based doses: Vitamin E (400-800 IU), Magnesium glycinate (300-400mg), Omega-3 (1000-2000mg EPA/DHA)."
  - "🌶️ Eliminate trigger foods for 2 weeks to test: alcohol, caffeine, spicy foods, hot beverages, refined sugar."
  - "📊 Keep a food-symptom log: track what you eat and hot flash intensity 2-3 hours later to identify your personal triggers."

motivation_nudge: "🌸 Every nourishing bite supports hormonal balance — your plate is a powerful tool for symptom relief."

habit_strategy: |
  **Nutritional Substitution** — Replacing inflammatory trigger foods with phytoestrogen-rich alternatives steadies temperature regulation.
  
  Swap morning coffee for green tea with ground flaxseed stirred in — reduce trigger, add support.
  
  🥬 **Tip:** Keep phytoestrogen foods visible: tofu in front of fridge, flaxseed by coffee maker, edamame as snack.
