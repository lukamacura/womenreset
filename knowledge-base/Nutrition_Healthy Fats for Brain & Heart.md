  As estrogen drops, your natural heart and brain protection lowers — so **healthy fats become essential** 💜.

  Focus on unsaturated fats: olive oil, nuts, seeds, avocado, and omega-3 rich fish like salmon or sardines. They improve mood, memory, and reduce inflammation 🌿.

  Fats don’t make you gain weight — excess calories do. The right fats are nourishing fuel for your brain, heart, and hormones.

action_tips:
  - "🥑 Use extra virgin olive oil as your main cooking oil."
  - "🐟 Eat fatty fish like salmon, sardines, or mackerel twice weekly."
  - "🌰 Snack on a small handful of nuts or seeds daily (walnuts, chia, flax)."

habit_strategy: |
  **Smart Substitution** — Replacing unhealthy fats with good ones improves heart and hormone health.
  
  Swap butter on toast for olive oil or avocado spread.
  
  🍽️ **Tip:** Try switching one daily fat — your taste buds adjust quickly.

motivation_nudge: "💜 Healthy fats don’t make you soft — they make you strong, focused, and radiant."
