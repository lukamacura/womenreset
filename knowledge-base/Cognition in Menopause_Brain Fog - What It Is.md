content_text: |
  That foggy, forgetful feeling can be unsettling — but you're not alone 💜. Around **60% of women** experience some level of brain fog in perimenopause or menopause. It often shows up as losing words mid-sentence, forgetting why you entered a room, or struggling to focus on tasks that used to be easy.

  **Here's what's important to know**: This is **not dementia**, and it doesn't mean you're heading toward it. Brain fog is your brain responding to hormonal shifts — specifically estrogen's role in producing neurotransmitters like acetylcholine, which support memory and attention.

  The good news: for most women, brain fog is **temporary and reversible**. As your hormones stabilize (either naturally post-menopause or with support from HRT, lifestyle changes, or both), cognitive clarity typically returns 🌿.
  
action_tips:
  - "😴 **Protect sleep quality:** Keep a consistent bedtime/wake time and dim screens 60 minutes before bed."
  - "🚶‍♀️ **Move daily (even gently):** Aim for a 10–20 minute walk or light strength work to boost blood flow and focus."
  - "🐟 **Feed your brain:** Prioritize omega-3 sources (fatty fish 2x/week, or chia/flax/walnuts) plus plenty of colorful plants."
  - "🥚 **Build steady energy:** Include protein at breakfast and pair carbs with fiber to avoid blood-sugar spikes and crashes."
  - "🧘‍♀️ **Lower the “stress load”:** Try 2–5 minutes of slow breathing, a short stretch, or a quick outdoor reset when you feel scattered."
  - "🩺 **Consider medical options:** If symptoms are persistent or disruptive, discuss hormone therapy suitability with your clinician."
  - "📝 **Support memory:** Use small helpers — lists, reminders, or sticky notes."

habit_strategy: |
  **Note & Release** — Writing things down reduces mental load and clears space for focus.
  
  Keep a notebook or phone note open for quick thoughts or to-dos before bed.
  
  ✍️ **Tip:** Offload what’s in your head — your brain rewards you with calm clarity.

motivation_nudge: "✨ Your brain is adapting — your brilliance is there beneath the fog, just waiting for light to return."
