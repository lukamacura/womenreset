content_text: |
  That foggy, forgetful feeling can be unsettling — but you’re not alone 💜. Around **60% of women** experience some level of brain fog in perimenopause or menopause. It often shows up as losing words, forgetting why you entered a room, or struggling to focus.

  This isn’t dementia — it’s your brain responding to hormonal shifts, especially estrogen’s role in memory and neurotransmitters like acetylcholine. The good news: it’s **temporary and reversible** once hormones stabilize and your lifestyle supports recovery 🌿.

action_tips:
  - "💡 **Reframe it:** Your brain is adapting, not failing — clarity will return."
  - "📝 **Support memory:** Use small helpers — lists, reminders, or sticky notes."
  - "🧘‍♀️ **Protect your brain fuel:** Sleep, hydration, and steady blood sugar are essential."
