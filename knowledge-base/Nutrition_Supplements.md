  Food should always come first 🌿 — but supplements can fill real gaps.

  Common supports in menopause include: vitamin D + K2 for bones, omega-3s for brain and inflammation, magnesium for sleep and mood, collagen for skin and joints, and probiotics for gut balance. Creatine is another underused ally for muscle and brain health 💜.

  Personalization matters — test levels, don’t guess.

action_tips:
  - "🌞 Check vitamin D and magnesium with your doctor."
  - "🐟 Include omega-3s daily from fish or supplements."
  - "💊 Take collagen with vitamin C for better absorption."
  - "🧂 Use electrolytes after heavy sweating or hot flashes."

habit_strategy: |
  **Doctor Check-In** — Lab testing ensures your supplements match your actual needs.
  
  Ask for vitamin D, B12, and iron checks once a year.
  
  🍽️ **Tip:** Before buying anything, check levels — it saves time and money.

motivation_nudge: "🌸 Supplements aren’t about perfection — they’re gentle helpers that fill gaps when food falls short."
