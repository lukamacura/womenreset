content_text: |
  Many women notice their minds feel slower or foggier — but this phase is **reversible** 💜.

  Your brain is recalibrating to hormonal changes, especially fluctuating estrogen. You can help it find balance again through simple, consistent nourishment, movement, sleep, and calm 🌿. With steady rhythm, clarity and focus return stronger than before.

action_tips:
  - "🌿 **Feed your neurons:** Eat Mediterranean-style — greens, berries, olive oil, fish, legumes, and omega-3s."
  - "💪 **Move daily:** 30 minutes of walking or strength training boosts oxygen and BDNF — your brain’s growth factor."
  - "😴 **Prioritize deep sleep:** Keep a cool, dark room and regular bedtime. Sleep cleans your brain and resets focus."
  - "🧘‍♀️ **Lower cortisol:** Try 4-7-8 breathing or 5-minute mindfulness to calm your stress circuits."

habit_strategy:
strategy: "Protect your brain’s energy every morning"
explanation: "In the menopause transition, the brain may struggle with fuel efficiency—so a simple morning routine that supports steady energy can reduce brain fog and improve focus."
example: "Within 60 minutes of waking, get 10 minutes of outdoor light, then eat a protein-forward breakfast (e.g., Greek yogurt + walnuts + berries, or eggs + veggies) before your first caffeine."

motivation_nudge:
  - "✨ Your brain isn’t fading — it’s rewiring for a wiser phase of life."
