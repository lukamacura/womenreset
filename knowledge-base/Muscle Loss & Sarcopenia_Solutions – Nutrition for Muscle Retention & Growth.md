   🌸 Nutrition is just as important as exercise for rebuilding and protecting muscle in menopause. As estrogen declines, your body becomes less efficient at turning dietary protein into muscle — a process called anabolic resistance.
   To overcome this, aim for 1.2–1.6 g of protein per kg of body weight per day, spread evenly across meals. Include high-quality sources like fish, eggs, yogurt, tofu, beans, and lean meats. Don't forget strength-supporting nutrients like omega-3s, vitamin D, and magnesium for energy and recovery 💪.

action_tips:
  - "🍳 Include 25–35 g of protein per meal to trigger muscle repair."
  - "🥗 Add colorful anti-inflammatory foods (berries, greens, olive oil) daily."
  - "💧 Stay hydrated — muscle tissue needs water for repair and strength."
  - "🕑 Eat protein-rich meals within 1–2 hours post-workout for recovery."
  - "💊 Consider creatine (3–5 g/day) and vitamin D if levels are low."

  **Visual Cue Implementation Intention** — Setting visual reminders and pre-planned protein targets for each meal removes the cognitive burden of daily decision-making. When you attach a specific protein goal to each eating occasion and make ingredients visible, you transform abstract nutrition advice into automatic action. This leverages implementation intentions (if-then planning) to override old eating patterns with muscle-supporting habits.
  
  Sunday prep: portion 25-35g protein servings in clear containers for the week (hard-boiled eggs, Greek yogurt, cooked chicken, tofu cubes). Place them at eye level in the fridge. Create the rule: “When I open the fridge for any meal, I grab one protein container first.” Or use a visual breakfast anchor: “After I pour my coffee, I crack 2 eggs—no exceptions.”
  
  🍽️ **Tip:** Prep 3 days of grab-and-go protein portions at once—visibility + accessibility = consistency without willpower.
