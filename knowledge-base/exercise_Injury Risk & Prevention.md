  After menopause, estrogen drops — collagen declines, tissues dry out, and repair slows. That’s why soreness lasts longer and injuries like tendonitis, plantar fasciitis, and back pain appear more easily. But prevention is powerful: strength training, smart warm-ups, and active recovery protect your joints and tendons.

  👉 **Train smart, not hard:**
  • **Warm-up:** 5–10 minutes of gentle movement prepares muscles and ligaments.  
  • **Progress slowly:** increase load or volume by ~10% per week.  
  • **Strength train:** 2–3× weekly to stabilize joints and bones.  
  • **Recover well:** rest, stretch, hydrate, and refuel within an hour post-workout.

  Menopause doesn’t make you fragile — it just means your body needs precision and care.

action_tips:
  - "🔥 **Warm Up First:** 5–10 min of dynamic moves (leg swings, arm circles)."
  - "💪 **Lift Smart:** Strength train 2–3×/week — muscles protect joints."
  - "🧊 **Use Recovery Tools:** Foam roll, stretch, hydrate, protein + vitamin C for repair."
  - "📅 **Plan Rest:** 1–2 full recovery days weekly to prevent overuse."
  - "👟 **Check Gear:** Supportive shoes and mats reduce impact stress."

motivation_nudge: "❤️ Injuries aren’t a setback — they’re feedback. Every recovery habit you build today keeps you moving pain-free tomorrow."
