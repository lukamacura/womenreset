  You can't manage what you don't measure 💜. Bone density testing gives you objective data about your skeletal health and tracks changes over time. The DEXA scan is the gold standard — a quick, painless test that measures bone density in your hip and spine, producing a T-score that guides treatment decisions.
  
  Understanding your numbers empowers informed action. A T-score of -1.0 or higher is normal, -1.0 to -2.5 indicates osteopenia (low bone mass), and -2.5 or lower means osteoporosis. Blood tests can reveal vitamin D deficiency or other factors affecting bone health. Regular monitoring shows whether your prevention strategies are working 🌿.

action_tips:
  - "🩺 Schedule your first DEXA scan: at menopause onset if risk factors present, or by age 65 for all women (earlier if family history, fractures, or steroid use)."
  - "📊 Learn to interpret T-scores: -1.0 or higher (normal), -1.0 to -2.5 (osteopenia - act now), -2.5 or lower (osteoporosis - need treatment)."
  - "📅 Plan follow-up scans strategically: every 1-2 years if osteopenia/treatment, every 2-3 years if normal with risk factors, every 5 years if low risk."
  - "💉 Request vitamin D blood test: optimal level for bone health is 30-50 ng/mL (supplement if under 30, adjust dose if over 50)."
  - "📋 Track height annually: loss of 1+ inch since peak height signals possible vertebral compression fractures."

motivation_nudge: "📈 Numbers tell your bone story — tracking progress shows your efforts are working and guides smart adjustments."
