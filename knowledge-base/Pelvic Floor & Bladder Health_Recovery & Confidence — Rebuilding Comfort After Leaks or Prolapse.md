content_text: |
  Healing isn't only physical — it's emotional too 💜. When leaks or pelvic discomfort happen, many women feel embarrassed or disconnected from their bodies. But your body isn't failing you — it's communicating. With consistent care, patience, and self-kindness, confidence returns right alongside strength. Each small success — fewer leaks, longer holds, steadier posture — is proof your system is rebuilding 🌿. Healing is progress, not perfection.

action_tips:
  - "🧘 Practice 5 minutes of slow breathing daily to calm tension in pelvic muscles."
  - "📔 Track tiny wins — note when urgency lessens or control improves."
  - "💬 Talk openly with your clinician or therapist; sharing helps normalize recovery."
  - "🚶 Move gently each day — walking, stretching, or yoga support circulation."
  - "💧 Stay hydrated and celebrate body comfort, not performance."

motivation_nudge: "🌸 Your strength is already returning — every mindful breath, squeeze, or walk is part of your comeback story."

habit_strategy:
  principle: "Body Trust Reinforcement"
  explanation: "Acknowledging small improvements reinforces motivation and neural connection."

  habit_tip: "💜 Pair self-compassion with consistency — kindness is the best long-term motivator."
