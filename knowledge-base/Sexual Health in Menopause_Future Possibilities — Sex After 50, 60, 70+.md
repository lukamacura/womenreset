content_text: |
  Pleasure has no expiration date 💜. Many women find sex more satisfying in midlife and beyond: more intentional, less performative, and grounded in self-knowledge and confidence. With open communication, pelvic care, and appropriate support, pleasure doesn't just return — it deepens. Experience, honesty, and letting go of old scripts can make intimacy richer in your 60s and 70s than it was in your 30s.

action_tips:
  - "📚 Read memoirs or articles about sexuality after 50+ for inspiration and normalization (reframe aging as sexual evolution)."
  - "🔄 Try one new sensory experience monthly: massage oils, different textures, temperatures, positions, or settings."
  - "📅 Schedule quarterly 'intimacy check-ins' with your partner to discuss what's evolving, what feels good, and what to explore next."
  - "🎭 Release old 'should' narratives about frequency, type, or performance — define sexuality on your current terms."
  - "💡 Explore expansive definitions of intimacy: sensual touch, emotional closeness, playfulness beyond penetration."

    🌺 This chapter is about quality, depth, and joy — not performance.

  **Curiosity Over Routine** — Ongoing exploration keeps neural pathways flexible and desire alive across decades.
  
  Once monthly, ask your partner: “What’s one thing we’ve never tried that sounds interesting?” Then research it together.
  
  💞 **Tip:** Curiosity is a powerful longevity tool for intimacy.
