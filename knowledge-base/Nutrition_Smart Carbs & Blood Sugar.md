  You don’t need to cut carbs — you just need to **choose them wisely** 💜.

  Smart carbs are slow-digesting and fiber-rich: oats, beans, quinoa, vegetables, and fruit. They keep blood sugar steady, reduce cravings, and give lasting energy 🌸.

  What to limit? Refined carbs and sugary snacks — they cause quick highs and crashes that can worsen hot flashes, fatigue, and mood swings.

action_tips:
  - "🥗 Pair carbs with protein (like beans + veggies or chicken + rice)."
  - "🍠 Choose slow carbs like oats, lentils, or sweet potatoes."
  - "🍓 Eat fruit instead of juice for natural fiber and fewer sugar spikes."

habit_strategy: |
  **Protein Pairing** — Balancing carbs with protein slows digestion and keeps blood sugar stable.
  
  Add eggs with toast or yogurt with fruit.
  
  🍽️ **Tip:** Tip: Never eat carbs alone — always pair them with protein.

motivation_nudge: "🌸 Smart carbs are your steady fuel — they power your brain, mood, and metabolism."
