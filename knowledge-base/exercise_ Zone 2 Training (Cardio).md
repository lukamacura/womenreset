   Many women think only intense workouts bring results — but Zone 2 is your quiet powerhouse 💜.

  **Zone 2 exercise** means steady, comfortable cardio — like brisk walking, easy cycling, or swimming — where you can talk in full sentences but not sing. It’s the sweet spot between too easy and too hard.

  🌿 **Why it matters in menopause:**  
  • Builds your aerobic base and trains your body to burn fat efficiently.  
  • Calms your nervous system and lowers cortisol.  
  • Strengthens your heart as estrogen declines.  
  • Boosts mitochondria — your energy factories — for steadier daily vitality.  
  • Keeps mood balanced and sleep more restful.

  👉 Aim for **3–4 sessions per week**, about **30–50 minutes each**, adding up to roughly **150 minutes per week**. Even 20–30 minutes, done consistently, changes how your body handles stress and energy.

  **Zone 2 vs HIIT:**  
  Zone 2 is your foundation — slow, strong, sustainable.  
  HIIT is your spark — short, intense bursts that add edge and variety.  
  You need both, but Zone 2 builds the endurance that makes HIIT safe and effective.

  🩷 **Quick Routine (Women 40+)**  
  • 5 min warm-up walk or pedal  
  • 30–40 min steady pace — talkable but focused  
  • 5 min cooldown stretch or stroll  
  Do this 3–4× weekly — it’s your longevity ritual, not a punishment.
