  Perimenopause is your body’s hormonal roller coaster before menopause — the long transition when your ovaries begin to slow down and your brain and body start to adjust 💜.

  Your estrogen and progesterone levels don’t just drop overnight — they swing wildly up and down, like a flickering light. That’s why some days you feel great, and others you wonder what’s happening to you.

  You might still have periods, but everything can feel different: mood, sleep, metabolism, skin, and energy. This phase usually starts in your 40s (sometimes late 30s) and lasts around 4–8 years — until your periods stop for good.

  Think of it as the bridge between your fertile years and menopause — not just a reproductive change, but a whole-body and brain transition where your system is learning to run on new settings.

  **What’s happening:**  
  💫 Your ovaries start to “retire,” and hormones rise and fall unpredictably.  
  🧠 Your brain feels every swing — affecting mood, memory, and sleep.  
  🔥 Your body temperature, energy, and metabolism can fluctuate.
