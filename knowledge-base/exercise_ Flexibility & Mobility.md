  Feeling stiff in the morning or after sitting is one of the most common midlife changes. It’s not weakness — it’s your body adapting to lower estrogen and slower collagen turnover.

  **Flexibility** is how far a muscle can stretch (like a rubber band).  
  **Mobility** is how well a joint moves through its range (like a hinge).  
  You need both to move freely and avoid pain or injury.

  🌿 **Why it matters after 40:**  
  • Reduces morning stiffness and tension  
  • Keeps joints supple and pain-free  
  • Improves posture and balance (hello, fall prevention!)  
  • Calms the nervous system and helps with sleep  
  • Adds lightness and grace to daily movement

  🧘 **Quick Daily Routine (5–10 min):**  
  • Cat–Cow ×5 (spine)  
  • Hip flexor stretch — 20 sec/side  
  • Chest opener — 20 sec  
  • Hamstring stretch — 20 sec/side  
  • Shoulder rolls ×10  

  ✨ **Yoga** adds calm and flexibility.  
  ✨ **Pilates** builds mobility and strength.  
  Either can become your moving meditation — choose what feels good in your body.

action_tips:
  - "🪨 Stretch daily for 5–10 minutes — short and consistent wins."
  - "⚡ Add mobility drills for hips, shoulders, and spine (cat–cow, hip circles)."
  - "🚫 Don’t stretch cold muscles — warm up first for safety."
  - "🌟 Pair stretching with anchors like morning or bedtime routines."

habit_strategy:
  strategy: "Attach to Daily Anchors"
  explanation: "Link stretching to routines you already have."
  example: "After brushing your teeth or before bed, take 5 minutes for gentle mobility."
  habit_tip: "Tiny daily movement doses beat long occasional sessions every time."

motivation_nudge: "💖 Stretching isn’t a luxury — it’s self-care for your joints, posture, and peace of mind."
