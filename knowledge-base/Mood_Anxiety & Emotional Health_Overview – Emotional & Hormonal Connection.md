  It's so common to feel more emotional during menopause 💜. Estrogen helps balance serotonin, dopamine, and GABA — brain chemicals that steady mood, focus, and calm. When hormones fluctuate, your brain recalibrates like a second puberty: some days clear, others tearful or irritable. These waves are temporary and reversible with the right support — through lifestyle, therapy, or gentle hormone balance.

action_tips:
  - "🧘 Begin your day with calm — a few slow breaths or stretching lowers cortisol spikes."
  - "🍽️ Include omega-3s and protein to feed your mood-steadying neurotransmitters."
  - "🌙 Keep consistent bedtime rituals — your brain restores balance while you sleep."

motivation_nudge: "🌿 You're not broken — your brain is adapting, not failing."
