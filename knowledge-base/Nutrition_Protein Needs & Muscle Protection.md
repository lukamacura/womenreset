  Losing strength or tone in menopause can feel frustrating — but you’re not powerless 💪🌸.

  Your body simply needs **more protein** to stay strong and metabolically active. Aim for roughly **1.6–2.2 g per kg body weight per day**, spread evenly across meals (around 25–30 g each). That’s about one palm-sized portion of protein at every meal.

  Whole foods come first — fish, eggs, tofu, beans, yogurt — but protein powders are helpful for busy mornings or after workouts. Combined plant proteins (like pea + rice) can fully meet your needs 💜.

action_tips:
  - "🍳 Begin breakfast with 25–30 g of protein (like eggs, Greek yogurt, or tofu)."
  - "🥗 Anchor each meal with protein first — then add colorful plants and healthy fats."
  - "🥤 Have a protein shake post-workout or during busy mornings."
  - "☕ Try a protein coffee or smoothie if you tend to skip breakfast."

habit_strategy: |
  **Meal Anchoring** — Placing protein first at every meal builds a consistent habit.
  
  Start lunch with chicken, beans, or eggs before adding sides.
  
  🍽️ **Tip:** Tip: plan your protein first — everything else builds around it.

motivation_nudge: "🌸 Think of protein as your midlife armor — it protects your strength, confidence, and vitality."
