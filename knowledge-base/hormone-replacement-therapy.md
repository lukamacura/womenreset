- Progestin protects against uterine cancer
- Available in various forms and combinations

## Benefits

- Significant reduction in hot flashes and night sweats
- Improved sleep quality
- Relief from vaginal dryness and discomfort
- Protection against bone loss and osteoporosis
- May help with mood swings and brain fog
- Reduced risk of colon cancer

## Risks and Considerations

### Potential Risks
- Increased risk of blood clots (especially with oral HRT)
- Slightly increased risk of stroke
- Increased risk of breast cancer (varies by type and duration)
- Increased risk of gallbladder disease

### Who Should Avoid HRT
- Women with a history of breast cancer
- Women with a history of blood clots

## Important Considerations

- HRT is not right for everyone
- Benefits and risks vary by individual
- Age and time since menopause matter

- Discuss personal health history with healthcare provider
