  Exercise isn't just for fitness — it's sleep medicine 🌿. But in menopause, **timing matters as much as movement type**.
  
  **Daytime movement** (morning/afternoon) balances cortisol, boosts serotonin, and helps your body naturally cool at night. **Intense workouts too close to bedtime** raise body temperature and adrenaline, making sleep elusive 🌙.
  
  **Evening should be gentle**: yoga, stretching, or slow breathing activate your "rest and digest" system, preparing you for deep sleep.
  
  The sweet spot? Finish intense exercise at least 3 hours before bed, and use the evening for calm, restorative movement.

action_tips:
  - "⏰ **Finish intense workouts 3+ hours before bed** — your body needs time to cool."
  - "🌅 **Morning or afternoon for strength/cardio** — it balances hormones without disrupting sleep."
  - "🧘 **Evening = gentle yoga or stretching** — active poses, not lying-down relaxation."
  - "🚶 **Walk daily** — even 20 minutes improves sleep quality significantly."
  - "💤 **Include rest days** — recovery is when your hormones rebuild."

motivation_nudge: "💖 Motion by day builds restoration by night. Every walk, lift, or stretch tells your body, *“I’m safe — it’s okay to rest now.”*"
