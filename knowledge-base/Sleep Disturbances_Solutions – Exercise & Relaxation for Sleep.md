  Exercise isn’t just for fitness — it’s sleep medicine 🌿. The right rhythm of movement and recovery trains your hormones and nervous system to sync again.
  
  Morning or afternoon workouts help balance cortisol, making it easier to unwind at night. Strength training builds estrogen sensitivity and stabilizes blood sugar, while light cardio boosts serotonin and energy.
  
  Evening movement should be calm, not intense — think yoga, gentle stretching, or slow breathing. These practices activate your parasympathetic system — your body’s natural ‘off switch’ — preparing you for deep rest 🌙.

action_tips:
  - "🏋️ **Do strength or cardio** earlier in the day to balance hormones and energy."
  - "🚶 Move daily: even 20–30 minutes of walking improves sleep quality."
  - "🧘 In the evening, switch to calm: yoga, stretching, or slow breathwork."
  - "🌬️ Try 4–7–8 breathing: inhale 4, hold 7, exhale 8 — it lowers heart rate fast."
  - "💤 Pair movement with recovery: rest days are when your hormones rebuild."

motivation_nudge: "💖 Motion by day builds restoration by night. Every walk, lift, or stretch tells your body, *“I’m safe — it’s okay to rest now.”*"
