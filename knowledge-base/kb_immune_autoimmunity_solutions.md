  You can absolutely support your immune system through gentle consistency 🌿. Think Mediterranean-style eating — colorful plants, olive oil, lean proteins — plus steady movement, deep sleep, and daily calm. Every balanced meal and mindful breath tells your body, *'I'm safe; you can relax.'* 💜

action_tips:
  - "🥗 Fill half your plate with colorful veggies and fruits."
  - "🐟 Add omega-3 foods (salmon, flax, chia) weekly."
  - "😴 Prioritize 7–8 hours of sleep — your nightly immune tune-up."
  - "🧘‍♀️ Practice 5 minutes of calm — meditation or slow stretching."
  - "☀️ Check vitamin D yearly — it shapes immune resilience."

motivation_nudge: "✨ Healing your immune system is about rhythm, not rules — compassion builds consistency."

habit_strategy:
  principle: "Multi-System Anti-Inflammatory Support"
  explanation: "Immune balance requires simultaneous support across nutrition, sleep, stress, and movement—no single intervention works in isolation. The most effective approach layers foundational habits: anti-inflammatory eating reduces inflammatory triggers, quality sleep enables immune repair, stress management prevents cortisol-driven inflammation, and gentle movement improves circulation and immune cell function. Together, these create synergistic immune support."
  example: "Week 1-2 foundation: Add one anti-inflammatory food daily (berries at breakfast, leafy greens at lunch, salmon twice weekly). Protect 7.5hr sleep window. Week 3-4 layer: Add 10-minute morning walk + 5-minute evening breathing practice. Week 5-6 optimize: Vitamin D supplementation if levels low, reduce inflammatory foods (processed sugar, refined oils). Track inflammation markers (joint pain, fatigue, brain fog) on 1-10 scale—most see improvement by week 4-6 with consistent multi-system approach."
  habit_tip: "🔄 Start with your easiest lever (for most: nutrition), build consistency for 2 weeks, then add next layer. Trying to overhaul everything at once usually fails—sequential layering builds sustainable immune support."
