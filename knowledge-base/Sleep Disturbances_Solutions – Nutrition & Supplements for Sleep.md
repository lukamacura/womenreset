  What you eat — and *when* you eat — quietly shapes your sleep hormones 🌙.
  
  Low estrogen and progesterone can make blood sugar more unstable, triggering cortisol spikes and night waking. The goal is steady fuel and calming nutrients that whisper to your body, *“you’re safe to rest.”*
  
  Focus on gentle dinners: lean protein, complex carbs, and a bit of healthy fat. Magnesium (especially glycinate or threonate) relaxes muscles and nerves, while glycine, GABA, or 5-HTP support serotonin and melatonin balance. Herbal teas like chamomile, lemon balm, or valerian add an extra layer of calm.
  
  Avoid alcohol, heavy meals, and caffeine late in the day — they fragment sleep even if you fall asleep faster.

action_tips:
  - "🍽️ **Eat a balanced dinner** 2–3 hours before bed — include protein + complex carbs."
  - "🥛 Try calming nutrients: magnesium glycinate, glycine, or chamomile tea before bed."
  - "🚫 **Skip alcohol and caffeine** after late afternoon to prevent hot flashes and night waking."
  - "🍒 **Experiment with tart cherry juice** for natural melatonin support."
  - "🌿 Stay consistent: steady nutrition equals steady sleep."

motivation_nudge: "💜 Every calm night begins hours earlier — with the steady fuel and minerals that help your body feel safe enough to rest."
