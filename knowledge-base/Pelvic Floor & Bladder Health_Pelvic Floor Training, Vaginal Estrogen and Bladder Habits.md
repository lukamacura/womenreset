  Your pelvic floor deserves the same attention as your heart and muscles — it's your lifelong support system 💜. The best protection against leaks, urgency, or prolapse combines **training**, **local estrogen**, and **smart bladder habits**. Kegels strengthen the muscles supporting your bladder and urethra, and a pelvic floor therapist can ensure you're doing them effectively. Local vaginal estrogen restores moisture, elasticity, and circulation with minimal systemic effects. When you stay active, maintain a healthy weight, and avoid bladder irritants like caffeine, you're building comfort and confidence from the inside out 🌿.

action_tips:
  - "🏋️‍♀️ Practice 3 sets of 10 Kegels per day — hold 5–10 seconds, then rest."
  - "🧘‍♀️ Exhale as you contract to avoid straining and build inner stability."
  - "💧 Drink water steadily through the day — dehydration worsens irritation."
  - "☕ Reduce caffeine, alcohol, and carbonated drinks if urgency persists."
  - "🌸 Ask your clinician about local vaginal estrogen for dryness or recurrent infections."

motivation_nudge: "✨ Your pelvic floor is *trainable* — every mindful squeeze strengthens both body and confidence."

habit_strategy: |
  **Anchor & Activate** — Pairing pelvic-floor work with daily cues keeps training effortless and consistent.
  
  Do gentle contractions each time you wash your hands or wait for your coffee to brew.
  
  🌼 **Tip:** Habit-stack your care — small, consistent efforts lead to lasting results.
