 Your vaginal and urinary health are deeply connected to your *whole-body balance*. Estrogen supports tissues through **circulation, collagen, and inflammation control** — and lifestyle choices can do the same.

  Regular movement, restorative sleep, balanced meals, and stress relief all improve blood flow, tissue repair, and hormone sensitivity. It’s whole-body self-care that shows up even in the most delicate places 💗.

action_tips:
  - "🏋️‍♀️ Move daily — mix **strength, mobility, and light cardio** to boost circulation."
  - "🥗 Eat an **anti-inflammatory diet**: colorful plants, omega-3s, lean protein."
  - "😴 Aim for **7–8 hours of deep, regular sleep** — it regulates hormone balance."
  - "🧘‍♀️ Practice **stress-releasing rituals** like breathwork or mindful walks."
  - "💧 Hydrate steadily — even mild dehydration can worsen dryness."

motivation_nudge: "🌸 Every act of care — movement, rest, nourishment — becomes hormone support from the inside out."
