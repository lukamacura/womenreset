  Let's be clear: your body didn't betray you. It shifted gears—and no one handed you the manual.
  
  As estrogen declines, your cells become less responsive to insulin. This means glucose doesn't get ushered into muscle as efficiently—it lingers in the bloodstream, then gets shuttled into fat storage, particularly visceral fat around your abdomen. Combine that with age-related muscle loss (sarcopenia) and a metabolic slowdown of 100–200 calories per day, and suddenly the same eating patterns that worked for years... don't.
  
  This isn't about willpower. It's insulin resistance meeting hormonal flux—classic midlife physiology.
  
  **The good news?** Muscle is metabolically active and insulin-sensitive. Strength training 2–3 times per week, eating protein at every meal, prioritizing fiber, and protecting your sleep can restore insulin sensitivity and reclaim metabolic flexibility. Your body can still adapt—it just needs the right signals.

action_tips:
  - "🏋️ Lift weights 2–3× weekly — muscle is your metabolic engine."
  - "🥦 Eat 25–35 g of fiber daily to steady blood sugar and hormones."
  - "🍳 Include 25–30 g protein per meal to preserve muscle and reduce cravings."
  - "🚶‍♀️ Move after meals — even 10 minutes helps glucose control."
  - "😴 Prioritize deep sleep — poor rest raises cortisol and blood sugar."

motivation_nudge: "💪 Your metabolism isn't broken — it's just waiting for better instructions from you."

habit_strategy: |
  **Metabolic Reset Routine** — Small, consistent muscle and blood sugar habits retrain your metabolism to burn instead of store energy.
  
  Pair each meal with 10 minutes of walking or light activity to keep glucose and insulin stable.
  
  🔥 **Tip:** Think: protein, movement, fiber — the three daily cues your metabolism understands best.
