content_text: |
  Creatine helps your muscles and brain produce quick energy ⚡ — and many women don’t get enough from diet alone.

  Taking **3–5 g daily** supports strength, bone density (when paired with resistance training), and mental clarity. **Creatine monohydrate** is the gold standard: safe, effective, and affordable 💜.

  It’s especially valuable for active women or those rebuilding muscle after 40.

action_tips:
  - "💊 If approved by a clinician, take 3–5 g creatine monohydrate daily, mixed in water or a smoothie."
  - "🥤 Combine with a protein shake or post-workout meal for better absorption."
  - "💧 Stay hydrated — water supports creatine’s muscle and brain benefits."

motivation_nudge: "💜 Creatine isn’t just for athletes — it’s a quiet powerhouse for midlife strength, bones, and focus."
