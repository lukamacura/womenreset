  Digestion changes in midlife. Hormonal shifts reshape your **gut microbiome**, the community of bacteria that support digestion, mood, and metabolism.

  As estrogen declines, it alters the *estrobolome* — gut bacteria that recycle estrogen. When balance slips, bloating, sluggish digestion, or inflammation can follow.

  The good news 💜: your gut is highly adaptable. Feed it fiber-rich plants, fermented foods, and plenty of water. These habits help your microbes rebalance hormones, calm inflammation, and improve mood naturally.

action_tips:
  - "🥗 Eat a rainbow — aim for 30+ different plant foods weekly."
  - "🧄 Add garlic, onions, or leeks daily for natural prebiotics."
  - "🥛 Include fermented foods like kefir, yogurt, kimchi, or sauerkraut."
  - "🚶‍♀️ Move after meals to aid digestion and reduce bloating."
  - "🚰 Drink enough water — fiber works best when hydrated."

habit_strategy: |
  **Plant Variety Challenge** — Each new plant feeds different gut microbes that support hormone balance.
  
  Add five new plant foods this week — herbs, seeds, fruits, or veggies.
  
  🍽️ **Tip:** ‘Eat the rainbow’ — every color feeds a different microbe family.

motivation_nudge: "🌿 A happy gut is the quiet engine behind steady hormones, mood, and energy."
