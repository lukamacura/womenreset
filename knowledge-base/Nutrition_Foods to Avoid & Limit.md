  Yep—certain foods really can trigger or worsen menopause symptoms. 🌸.

  Common triggers include sugary snacks, processed foods, alcohol, caffeine, and salty or fried meals. These can spike blood sugar, fuel inflammation, and disrupt your sleep or body temperature.

  But don’t worry — it’s not about cutting everything out. It’s about noticing *your* patterns and finding a gentle balance 💜.

action_tips:
  - "🚫 Swap chips or sweets for nuts, fruit, or hummus with veggies."
  - "☕ If caffeine disrupts your sleep, switch your last cup to herbal tea."
  - "🍷 Keep alcohol to 1–2 drinks weekly and note if it triggers symptoms."

habit_strategy: |
  **Swap & Notice** — Replacing one trigger food at a time keeps it manageable.
  
  Try sparkling water with lemon instead of soda.
  
  🍽️ **Tip:** Track how you feel after cutting or swapping one item for a week.

motivation_nudge: "🌸 Small shifts can make a big difference — your body will thank you with calmer nights and steadier energy."
