  So many women tell me, “I do everything right, but my sleep still breaks.” 💜 Often, it’s not you — it’s your environment.
  
  Your body naturally cools down to fall asleep, but in menopause, temperature regulation can go rogue. A warm, cluttered, or noisy bedroom tells your brain to stay alert instead of letting go 🌙.
  
  The ideal setup feels like *spa meets cave*: **cool air, soft light, calm surroundings.** Breathable fabrics and moisture-wicking bedding help manage hot flashes, while blackout curtains and gentle white noise create a cocoon for deep rest.

action_tips:
  - "🌡️ **Set the temperature** around 18–20 °C / 65–68 °F for optimal sleep."
  - "🛏️ Choose breathable fabrics: cotton, bamboo, or moisture-wicking materials for bedding and PJs."
  - "🕶️ Block out light: use blackout curtains or a soft eye mask."
  - "🌬️ Stay cool: add a fan, cooling pillow, or ventilated mattress topper."
  - "🔇 Add soothing sounds: white noise or gentle nature sounds calm your alert system."

motivation_nudge: "😴 Your bedroom isn’t just a place to sleep — it’s your nightly sanctuary. Calm space, calm body, calm mind."
