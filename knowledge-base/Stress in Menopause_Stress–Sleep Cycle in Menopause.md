  That 3 a.m. wake-up with a racing mind? It's cortisol talking 💜.

  When estrogen and progesterone drop, your stress system stays switched on longer. High cortisol blocks melatonin, making it harder to fall or stay asleep. Then lack of sleep raises cortisol even more — a loop that leaves you tired *and* wired.

  The fix: calm cortisol before bed and reset your clock each morning 🌄.
  
   
  **💡 Awake right now at 3 a.m.?** Try step-by-step [3 a.m. Calm Reset Technique] for immediate help falling back asleep.
