  Your metabolism can't heal in chaos — it needs **calm, rest, and rhythm** 🌿.
  
  When stress hormones stay high, cortisol keeps blood sugar elevated and blocks fat loss. Add poor sleep, and your hunger and fullness hormones (ghrelin and leptin) flip — you crave quick carbs and store more around the belly.
  
  The fix isn't harder work — it's deeper recovery 💜. Consistent sleep, morning light, and calm breathing signal safety to your body, allowing estrogen, insulin, and cortisol to rebalance. That's when fat loss starts working *with* you, not against you.
  
  Chronic stress raises cortisol and insulin, suppressing fat-burning and increasing cravings. Rest, deep sleep, and relaxation lower stress hormones and improve metabolic flexibility.

action_tips:
  - "😴 Keep bedtime consistent — aim for 7–8 hours of dark, cool, quiet rest."
  - "🌞 Get morning sunlight to anchor your circadian rhythm."
  - "🧘 Practice 5 minutes of deep breathing or meditation daily."
  - "🚶‍♀️ Add gentle evening walks or stretching to calm the nervous system."
  - "🍵 Limit caffeine after 2 p.m. and alcohol before bed — both disrupt recovery."

motivation_nudge: "🌸 Fat loss begins with calm — not restriction. When your body feels safe, it lets go of what it no longer needs."

habit_strategy: |
  **Recovery Rhythm** — Repeating simple recovery cues daily trains your body to rest, repair, and rebalance hormones.
  
  Dim lights 30 minutes before bed, breathe deeply, and stretch gently to unwind.
  
  🌙 **Tip:** Treat rest as an active ingredient in your metabolism, not a reward after effort.
