  Estrogen does far more than balance mood — it actually fuels your brain 💜.

  It supports how your neurons use glucose, oxygen, and blood flow — the essentials for memory and clear thinking.

  When estrogen drops, these energy systems slow down, which can cause fog or fatigue. Research shows that starting hormone therapy early in menopause may help maintain these pathways — but timing, dosage, and personal health all matter. 🌿

  
action_tips:
  - "🩺 **Ask about the 'window of opportunity':** Early menopause HT may offer more brain protection than starting years later."
  - "📋 **Discuss your personal risk profile:** Family history, cardiovascular health, and cognitive concerns matter in decision-making."
  - "🧠 **Be specific about cognition:** Tell your provider if brain fog, memory, or focus are concerns alongside other symptoms."
  - "📚 **Stay informed:** Research on HT and brain health is evolving — ask for current evidence relevant to your situation."

motivation_nudge: - "💗 It’s natural to feel uncertain about hormone therapy — every woman’s story and biology are unique. 
                        Knowledge is power — understanding how hormones affect your brain helps you make the best choice for your body."
