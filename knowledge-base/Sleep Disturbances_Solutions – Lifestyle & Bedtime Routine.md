  Many women tell me, *“I’m exhausted, but my mind won’t stop.”* 🌙 That’s your nervous system stuck in alert mode.
  
  Your brain *loves* predictability. A soothing evening routine teaches it to shift from alert to relaxed, cueing your hormones that it’s time to rest. During menopause, cortisol can stay high into the evening, so your bedtime habits become your best hormonal signal for calm 💜.
  
  Think of bedtime as a *gentle landing*, not a crash. Dim the lights, silence screens, and do something grounding — stretch, write, breathe, or reflect. Over time, these cues whisper to your body, *“You’re safe. It’s time to rest.”*

action_tips:
  - "📖 Unplug an hour before bed: Swap scrolling for reading or gentle journaling."
  - "🧘 Stretch or do light yoga: Release tension and help cortisol drift down."
  - "💭 Write or voice-note worries: Empty your mind before rest."
  - "🎧 Listen to soft sounds or NSDR: Calm your nervous system deeply."
  - "⏰ Keep a steady bedtime: Regular rhythm builds hormonal balance."

motivation_nudge: "💖 You don’t need perfection — just rhythm. Every peaceful evening teaches your body how to feel safe again."
