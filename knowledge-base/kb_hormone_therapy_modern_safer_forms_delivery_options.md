content_text: |
  Modern Menopausal Hormone Therapy (MHT) offers safer delivery methods and bioidentical formulations compared to options from 20 years ago. This guide helps you understand your OPTIONS for HOW to take hormones — your clinician will determine the right DOSE for you.
  
  We now use bioidentical hormones — molecules chemically identical to those produced by your body — delivered through methods that reduce side effects and risk.
  
  **Transdermal estrogen (patches, gels, or sprays)** delivers hormones directly through the skin, avoiding first-pass metabolism in the liver. This lowers the risk of blood clots and stroke compared to oral tablets.
  
  **Micronized progesterone** is a body-identical form that's better tolerated than older synthetic progestins and may even support sleep.
  
  The key is personalization: choosing the right delivery method for your unique health profile, lifestyle, and preferences.

action_tips:
  - "💊 Compare transdermal options: Patches offer convenience (apply once or twice weekly), gels provide flexible dosing (daily), and sprays are quick-drying and easy to use."
  - "🌙 Choose micronized progesterone: It's bioidentical, gentle on the body, and often improves sleep quality."
  - "⚠️ Understand oral estrogen risks: Oral tablets carry higher clot risk due to liver metabolism — transdermal is safer for most women."
  - "🩺 Work with a menopause-trained clinician: Seek providers certified by NAMS or similar organizations for evidence-based guidance on choosing your delivery method."
  - "🏃‍♀️ Consider your lifestyle: Patches are convenient for busy schedules, gels offer precise dose control, sprays are travel-friendly."
