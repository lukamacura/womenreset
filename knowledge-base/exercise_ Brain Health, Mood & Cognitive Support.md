  Exercise is brain medicine 💡. When you move, your body pumps oxygen and growth factors (like BDNF) into your brain — literally recharging neurons. That’s why movement helps with brain fog, mood swings, and focus issues in menopause. Cardio boosts energy and memory, strength training lowers depression and sharpens thinking, and yoga or outdoor walks calm the nervous system. Even a 5-minute movement snack can flip your brain chemistry from tired to focused. Skipping movement often worsens fog and irritability. Consistent exercise keeps your brain younger, calmer, and more resilient.

action_tips:
  - "🚶 **Walk It Off:** A brisk 20-minute walk boosts blood flow and clears brain fog."
  - "🏋️ **Strength Up:** 2–3 sessions per week protect mood, memory, and motivation."
  - "🧘 **Mind-Body Reset:** Yoga or tai chi twice weekly reduce anxiety and tension."
  - "🌞 **Get Outside:** Sunlight + nature = serotonin + vitamin D boost."
  - "🎶 **Quick Fix:** Dance to one song or stretch for two minutes when your brain stalls."

habit_strategy: "Start a 10-minute 'Brain Walk' after lunch or dinner. Add one short strength or yoga session each week. Tiny, regular bursts of movement are the secret to steady energy and mental clarity."

motivation_nudge: "💜 Feeling foggy or flat? You’re not broken — your brain just needs movement fuel. Each walk, stretch, or squat delivers oxygen and calm to your neurons. Think of exercise not as a task, but as daily brain nourishment."
