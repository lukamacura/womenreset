 Most hot flashes are manageable with lifestyle changes 💜. But some situations warrant professional evaluation.
 See a healthcare provider if: flashes severely disrupt sleep (3+ nights/week for a month), occur with chest pain or heart irregularities, cause significant distress or depression, persist severely for 2+ years, or don't improve with basic interventions.
 You deserve quality of life — seeking help isn't weakness, it's wise health management 🌿.

action_tips:
- "🚨 Seek immediate evaluation if hot flashes occur WITH: chest pain, severe palpitations, dizziness, or shortness of breath."
- "📊 Schedule appointment if experiencing: 10+ moderate-severe flashes daily, chronic sleep disruption (3+ nights/week), or significant mood impact."
- "🩺 Request menopause specialist referral if: primary care provider lacks menopause training, symptoms don't improve with initial treatment, or you have complex health history."
- "💬 Communicate severity clearly: use tracking data showing frequency, intensity, sleep impact, and functional impairment."
- "⏰ Don't wait: average time women suffer before seeking help is 12-18 months — early intervention prevents compounding health effects."

motivation_nudge: "🌸 Severe symptoms deserve medical intervention — suffering isn't noble, it's unnecessarily harmful to your health and quality of life."
