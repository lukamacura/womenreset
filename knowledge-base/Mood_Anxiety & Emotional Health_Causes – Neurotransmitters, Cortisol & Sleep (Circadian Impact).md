content_text: |
  That's such a familiar feeling in midlife 💜 When estrogen falls, serotonin and dopamine — your mood-steadying messengers — slow down. Meanwhile, cortisol rises, especially when sleep is disrupted. This mix fuels anxiety, irritability, and low motivation. The goal isn't forced positivity — it's gentle chemistry repair: restore sleep, calm cortisol, and support neurotransmitters with food, light, and movement.

action_tips:
  - "🌞 Step into morning sunlight for 10 minutes — it resets your mood clock."
  - "🚶 Move daily — even short walks boost serotonin and endorphins."
  - "😴 Keep a fixed bedtime to steady cortisol and emotional balance."

motivation_nudge: "💫 Your feelings aren't random — they reflect your inner chemistry, and balance can return."

habit_strategy:
  principle: "Mood Reset Routine"
  explanation: "Light, movement, and recovery stabilize neurotransmitters."
  example: "Step outside right after waking — daylight anchors mood for the day."
  habit_tip: "🌞 Light + movement = calmer nights and steadier emotions."

follow_up_question: "Would you like to explore mind-body practices that calm your nervous system, learn how sleep rhythms affect emotional stability, or understand practical tools for emotional regulation?"
