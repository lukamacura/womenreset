  Menopause is the moment your ovaries officially retire 💜 — your periods have stopped for 12 months in a row, and your estrogen and progesterone have settled at a new, lower level.

  Technically, menopause is just **one day** — the anniversary of your last period. After that, you’re in *postmenopause* for the rest of your life.

  In medical terms, menopause marks **12 consecutive months without a period**. However, **in everyday language**, people often use “menopause” as an **umbrella term** that covers:  
  • **Perimenopause** – the transition years before the final period,  
  • **Menopause** – the official milestone,  
  • **Postmenopause** – the years after, when hormones remain low.

  That’s why so many women say, “I’m in menopause” — it simply describes this whole life stage of hormonal change and adaptation.
