  Many women are curious about fasting in midlife — and it can help, if done gently 🌸.

  **Time-restricted eating** (about 12–14 hours overnight) may support insulin sensitivity and fat metabolism. Some women extend to 16:8 if their sleep, energy, and mood stay stable.

  Overdoing it, though, can raise stress hormones and backfire 💜. Start small, listen to your body, and adjust your fasting window slowly.

action_tips:
  - "⏰ Begin gently (from 7 pm to 7 am.)"
  - "💤 If sleep or energy worsens, shorten your fasting window."
  - "🏋️ Eat before and after workouts to protect muscle and recovery."

habit_strategy: |
  **Gentle Start** — Starting smaller makes fasting more sustainable and less stressful.
  
  Try closing the kitchen earlier instead of skipping breakfast.
  
  🍽️ **Tip:** Do this: finish dinner earlier and skip late-night snacks.

motivation_nudge: "💜 Fasting is a flexible tool — even a gentle 12-hour reset can steady hormones and metabolism."

follow_up_question: "Would you like to explore mindful & emotional eating — like how to handle cravings, stress-snacking, and “I know what to do, but I can’t do it” moments with more ease?"
