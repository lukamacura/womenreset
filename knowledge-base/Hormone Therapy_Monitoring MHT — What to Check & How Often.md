content_text: |
  Monitoring keeps your hormone therapy safe, effective, and tailored to you 💜. Once you start MHT, the goal isn't endless testing — it's smart, steady observation.
  
  **✅ Typical check-up rhythm:**
  • **Initial review:** about 3 months after starting or changing therapy.
  • **Regular follow-ups:** every 6–12 months once stable.
  
  At each visit, your clinician will review symptoms, side effects, blood pressure, weight, and breast or pelvic health.
  
  **🧪 Blood tests:** Routine hormone level testing isn't needed for most women on MHT — how you *feel* is usually the best guide. Tests may be used if symptoms persist or if you're on testosterone or non-standard therapy.
  
  **🩺 Screening & safety checks:**
  • Mammogram and cervical screening as per national guidelines.
  • Bone-density (DEXA) scan every few years if you have osteoporosis risk or early menopause.
  • Blood pressure, cholesterol, and metabolic markers checked regularly.
  
  **🌿 Self-monitoring matters too:** Keep a short log of sleep, mood, hot flashes, and energy. Share trends at appointments — it helps fine-tune your care.

action_tips:
  - "📅 Mark review dates: Add reminders for your 3-month and yearly MHT check-ups."
  - "💬 Track key changes: Note improvements and any side effects to discuss with your clinician."
  - "🧠 Think whole health: Use visits to check blood pressure, breast exams, and bone health — not just hormones."
  - "🌸 Ask what's next: Confirm when your next mammogram or DEXA scan is due."

motivation_nudge: "🌿 Monitoring isn't about micromanaging — it's about caring for your future self. Regular reviews keep your therapy safe, balanced, and evolving with you."

habit_strategy: |
  **Weekly Symptom Snapshot** — A simple weekly check-in creates a pattern history that helps you and your clinician spot trends and adjust therapy accurately.
  
  Every Sunday evening, rate: hot flashes (how many this week?), sleep quality (1-10), mood, energy. Note any new symptoms. Review before appointments.
  
  📱 **Tip:** Set a recurring phone reminder: “Sunday 8pm - MHT symptom check” — takes 2 minutes, creates valuable data for your care.
