  You can lift all the weights in the world — but without recovery, progress stalls 💜.
 
  During menopause, lower estrogen slows repair and raises inflammation. This means slow recovery after workouts, even when you're consistent.

  🌿 **Remember that after 40:**  
  • Muscles need longer to repair and adapt  
  • Estrogen drop increases soreness and stress hormones  
 
  Muscle repair depends on deep sleep, calm nerves, and balanced hormones. When stress runs high or rest runs low, growth hormones dip and recovery slows. Aim for 7–9 hours of restful sleep and talk to your clinician about HRT if needed 🌿.

action_tips:
  - "🧘 Try breathing or NSDR before bed."
  - "🌙 Keep regular sleep-wake times."
  - "🩺 Discuss HRT with your provider."

motivation_nudge: "💤 Muscles remodel while you sleep — protect that sacred time."

habit_strategy: |
  **Evening Reset Routine** — A predictable wind-down signals recovery hormones. Consistent evening rituals cue your body that it's time to shift from stress mode (cortisol) to repair mode (growth hormone). By anchoring calming activities to a specific time each night, you create a biological trigger that prepares your muscles and nervous system for deep, restorative sleep—the foundation of muscle rebuilding.
  
  Dim lights at 9 PM, then do a 10-minute gentle stretch routine in the same spot each night. Follow with 5 minutes of box breathing (4-4-4-4) while sitting in your favorite chair. Your body learns: dimmed lights + stretching = sleep preparation is coming, which starts lowering cortisol and prepping growth hormone release.
  
  🌙 **Tip:** Set a phone alarm for 9 PM titled “Recovery Time”—then put devices in another room and begin your wind-down ritual.
