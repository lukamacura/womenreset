  Testosterone isn't just a male hormone — women make it too 💜. It plays an important role in sexual desire, energy, focus, mood, and muscle maintenance.
  
  In menopause, testosterone levels naturally decline, which can lead to fatigue, brain fog, lower motivation, and reduced libido. Carefully prescribed low-dose transdermal testosterone (gel or cream) can help restore vitality when monitored by a qualified clinician.
  
  It should always be taken from regulated pharmacies and used under supervision — not as pellets or high-dose injections. The goal is to restore natural balance, not to chase a number or build muscle mass.

action_tips:
  - "💧 Ask about testing: Before starting therapy, your clinician should check baseline testosterone levels to guide dosing."
  - "🌿 Choose regulated sources: Use prescribed creams or gels — avoid unregulated compounded versions or pellets."
  - "💗 After your morning shower, apply testosterone cream to your inner arm or thigh."
  - "🩺 Monitor regularly: Schedule follow-ups every 3–6 months to review labs, side effects, and progress."

motivation_nudge: "🌸 Balanced testosterone can help you feel more alive, focused, and confident — it's about restoring you, not becoming someone else."

follow_up_question: "Would you like to explore the safer modern forms of estrogen and progesterone, or understand how to personalize your complete hormone therapy plan?"
