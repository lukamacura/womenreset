  Strict rules create stress — and stress disrupts hormones 🌸. Emotional eating isn’t a lack of willpower; it’s your body’s way of seeking safety, rest, or comfort.

  The goal is **consistency with kindness**, not perfection. Follow the 80/20 principle: 80% nourishing foods, 20% joyful ones. Ask before eating, *“What am I really hungry for — food or comfort?”* 💜.

  Awareness transforms habits. When you meet emotional needs gently, food becomes nourishment, not coping.

action_tips:
  - "⚖️ Follow the 80/20 rule — mostly whole foods, some treats guilt-free."
  - "🪞 Pause before eating and name what you feel — tired, anxious, lonely."
  - "🌿 Build a ‘comfort menu’: walks, music, journaling, or warm tea instead of snacks."
  - "🕯️ End the day with a soothing ritual — it rewires stress patterns."

habit_strategy: |
  **Mindful Pause** — A few deep breaths before eating create space for choice.
  
  When stressed, breathe, name the feeling, then decide if you’re truly hungry.
  
  🍽️ **Tip:** Small pauses build self-trust — one meal at a time.

motivation_nudge: "💗 You don’t need willpower — you need kindness. Awareness is the most powerful diet skill you’ll ever learn."
