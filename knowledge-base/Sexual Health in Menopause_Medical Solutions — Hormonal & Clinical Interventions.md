  Sometimes your body needs direct support 💜. Local vaginal estrogen restores tissue health, moisture, and elasticity — with minimal systemic absorption. Systemic hormone therapy (MHT) can improve overall libido, energy, and mood. Pelvic floor therapy addresses muscle tone and pain. These medical interventions work best alongside lifestyle changes and emotional support, creating comprehensive care for your sexual health.

action_tips:
  - "💊 Ask your clinician about vaginal estrogen cream, tablets, or rings — learn application technique and frequency."
  - "📋 Discuss systemic MHT if you have multiple symptoms (hot flashes, mood, energy, libido) — explore risks and benefits for your profile."
  - "🩺 Get evaluated by a pelvic floor physical therapist for pain, tightness, or weakness affecting sexual comfort."
  - "💧 Use vaginal moisturizers (Replens, Hyalo Gyn) 2-3x weekly between sexual activity for ongoing tissue hydration."
  - "🔬 Request hormone level testing if symptoms are severe — consider testosterone evaluation if libido is absent."

    ✨ You deserve comfort and pleasure — modern medicine can help restore both.

habit_strategy: |
  **Consistent Medical Compliance** — Regular use of prescribed treatments creates cumulative tissue and hormonal benefits.
  
  Set a recurring phone alarm for vaginal estrogen application nights (e.g., Monday/Thursday 9pm).
  
  🩺 **Tip:** Consistency matters more than perfection — regular use builds lasting change.
