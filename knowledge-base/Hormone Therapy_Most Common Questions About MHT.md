content_text: |
  Menopausal Hormone Therapy (MHT) replaces the estrogen and progesterone that naturally decline at midlife. It's the most effective treatment for **hot flashes, night sweats, brain fog, sleep problems, mood changes, and vaginal dryness**.
  
  For most healthy women **younger than 60 or within ten years of their final period**, the benefits generally outweigh the risks. The safest forms are transdermal estrogen (patch, gel, or spray) and micronized progesterone if you have a uterus.
  
  Beginning treatment around the menopausal transition may help protect your bones, heart, brain, and muscle health — always under medical supervision.

action_tips:
  - "💬 Talk to a menopause-trained clinician — not all doctors specialize in MHT."
  - "🌸 Ask about transdermal estrogen + micronized progesterone, and low-dose testosterone if you struggle with libido or energy."
  - "🩷 Review annually with your provider; dosage may change as your body adapts."
  - "🧘 Combine MHT with lifestyle medicine: anti-inflammatory food, exercise, sleep, stress care."

motivation_nudge: "✨ This isn't vanity therapy — it's vitality therapy. Replacing what's missing helps protect your future health, not chase your youth 🌿."

habit_strategy: |
  **Symptom & Mood Tracking** — Keeping a short weekly log helps you and your clinician tailor hormones more accurately.
  
  Note how you sleep, think, and feel over the first 6–8 weeks — then discuss trends at review.
  
  📝 **Tip:** Pair reflection with your Sunday routine — it keeps you aware of subtle improvements.
