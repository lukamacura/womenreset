  Most women in midlife juggle a thousand things 💜.

  The truth? **Short workouts absolutely count.** Even 10–15 minutes can lift energy, balance hormones, and protect muscle.

  You don’t need a gym, fancy gear, or an hour of free time. **Bodyweight moves**, brisk walking, stairs, or resistance bands all work beautifully. Walking is fantastic — just add a few strength moves to protect bones and metabolism.

  👉 The magic is in **consistency**, not duration. Stack mini-workouts into your day: squats while the kettle boils, planks before a shower, a brisk walk on calls. Small steps create big changes over time.

action_tips:
  - "⏱️ **15-Min Fix:** 5 squats + 5 push-ups + 30-sec plank → repeat 3x."
  - "🏡 **No Gear?** Use stairs, walls, or chairs for a full-body mini workout."
  - "🧩 **Stack It:** Pair movement with daily habits (coffee → squats, TV → stretch)."
  - "🚶 **Upgrade Walking:** Add hills or light weights for stronger bones."

habit_strategy: "Start with one 10–15 minute session daily at the same time (e.g., after morning coffee). Focus on **routine first, intensity later.**"

motivation_nudge: "🌸 15 minutes a day may feel small, but over a year — that’s 90+ hours of movement. You’re doing more than you think!"
