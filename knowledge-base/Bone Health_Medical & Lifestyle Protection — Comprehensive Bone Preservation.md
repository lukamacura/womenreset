  Sometimes bones need medical reinforcement 💜. Menopausal Hormone Therapy (MHT) can significantly slow bone loss when started early in menopause. For those with osteoporosis or very high fracture risk, medications like bisphosphonates, denosumab, or romosozumab provide powerful bone protection.
  
  Beyond prescriptions, lifestyle habits create your daily defense: avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol, maintaining healthy body weight, preventing falls through home safety, and protecting your posture. These strategies work synergistically — medical treatment plus lifestyle optimization equals maximum bone protection 🌿.

action_tips:
  - "💊 Discuss MHT with your doctor if within 10 years of menopause: estrogen therapy reduces fracture risk by 30-40% and protects bone density."
  - "🩺 Consider bone medications if: T-score -2.5 or lower, prior fracture from minor trauma, or high FRAX score (>20% major fracture risk, >3% hip fracture risk)."
  - "🚭 Quit smoking immediately: smoking accelerates bone loss by 25%, impairs calcium absorption, and increases fracture risk by 50%."
  - "🍷 Limit alcohol to 1 drink daily maximum: >2 drinks daily interferes with bone formation and increases fall risk."
  - "🏠 Fall-proof your home: remove throw rugs, improve lighting (especially stairs/bathroom), install grab bars in shower, keep walkways clear, wear non-slip shoes indoors."

motivation_nudge: "✨ Medical treatment isn't failure — it's precision care that dramatically reduces fracture risk and preserves independence."
