  You can absolutely rebuild strength and muscle in menopause 🌿 — your body still listens beautifully when you give it the right signals.
  As estrogen declines, muscle protein synthesis slows and recovery takes longer. But resistance training reawakens those pathways — helping you regain lean muscle, support bone density, and boost metabolism. Whether it's free weights, resistance bands, or bodyweight work, consistency and gradual progression make the biggest difference.
  Start with 2–3 focused sessions per week, train major muscle groups, and give your body recovery time between sessions 💪.

action_tips:
  - "🏋️‍♀️ Begin with 2–3 resistance sessions per week, alternating upper and lower body."
  - "🧘 Add mobility and balance to protect joints and improve form."
  - "🥗 Support workouts with protein-rich meals and hydration for faster recovery."
  - "🕑 Allow 48 hours between sessions to rebuild and strengthen."

motivation_nudge: "Every rep tells your body you're not done getting stronger 💜 — it just needs new signals to adapt."
 
habit_strategy: |
  **Anchor-to-Resistance** — Attaching a short resistance session to an existing routine makes strength training automatic and easy to repeat.
  
  Pick one daily anchor (breakfast, lunch break, or evening walk) and do 15 minutes of resistance work immediately after.
  
  🔗 **Tip:** Use the same anchor every time — consistency beats intensity when you’re building the habit.
