  Heart palpitations are one of the most frightening symptoms of menopause—and also one of the least talked about. Many women describe lying awake at night, hand on chest, terrified something is seriously wrong with their heart. Some have been to the ER multiple times. 

  The good news: **most palpitations during menopause are not dangerous, even though they feel terrifying.** As estrogen and progesterone fluctuate, your body becomes more sensitive to adrenaline, which can trigger a racing or skipping heartbeat. Your nervous system is responding to dramatic hormone shifts. Your heart is not failing. But you still deserve answers, support, and strategies to manage them.

  Palpitations tend to settle once hormones stabilize. You can calm your heart by gently supporting your parasympathetic (rest-and-recover) system 🌿.

action_tips:
  - "🌬️ Try the **4-7-8 breathing** pattern (inhale 4s, hold 7s, exhale 8s) to slow heart rate."
  - "☀️ **Reduce caffeine, alcohol, and late-night screens** that overstimulate your system."
  - "🍽️ **Go smaller + steadier:** Eat smaller, more frequent meals/snacks built around **protein + healthy fats** to prevent energy crashes."
  - "🥚 **Use a simple plate anchor:** Each time you eat, include **one protein** (eggs, yogurt, chicken, tofu) + **one healthy fat** (olive oil, nuts, avocado)."
  - "💧 **Hydrate on a schedule:** Keep water nearby and sip regularly; aim for a glass on waking, mid-morning, mid-afternoon, and with meals."
  - "🧘‍♀️ **Practice stress skills daily:** Do 2–5 minutes of slow breathing, stretching, or a short walk **every day**, so it works when you need it."
  - "😴 **Lock in your sleep rhythm:** Keep the same bedtime/wake time most days; protect a 30–60 minute wind-down with dim lights and fewer screens."

motivation_nudge: "💖 Your heart isn’t broken — it’s reacting to change. With calm, consistent care, it finds balance again."

habit_strategy: |
  **Vagal Tone Building** — Building vagal tone (the strength of your parasympathetic nervous system) through daily breathing practices creates a buffer against palpitations. 
  
  Morning: 2 minutes of 4-7-8 breathing after waking builds baseline vagal tone. 

  🫀 **Tip:** When you feel palpitations, splash very cold water on your face, or hold a cold, wet washcloth or ice pack on your face for 30 seconds. This triggers the "dive reflex"—an evolutionary response that slows heart rate. Many women keep a washcloth in the freezer for nighttime episodes.
