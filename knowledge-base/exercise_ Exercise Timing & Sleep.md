  Ever notice how a workout can help you sleep — or sometimes make it worse? 🌙 In menopause, **timing matters more than ever** because your hormones affect both temperature and circadian rhythm.

  💜 **Here’s the short story:**  
  Regular exercise balances stress hormones, reduces hot flashes, and supports deep, restorative sleep — *if you time it right.*

  🌅 **Best times to move:**  
  • Morning or afternoon — boosts daytime energy and helps your body cool naturally at night.  
  • Afternoon strength training is ideal for many midlife women — cortisol is steady, and it won’t disrupt sleep.  
  • Avoid intense workouts within 3 hours of bedtime — high heart rate, heat, and cortisol can delay melatonin.

  🌿 **Evening? Keep it gentle:**  
  Try yoga, stretching, or slow mobility. Even 15 minutes calms your nervous system, reduces night sweats, and prepares you for rest.

  🌞 **Circadian reset tip:**  
  Exercise + morning light exposure helps your brain release cortisol earlier and melatonin later — a natural rhythm reset for better nights.

  😴 **Sleep-boosting combo:**  
  Regular exercise + early movement + cool-down rituals = deeper sleep, calmer mind, and fewer 3 a.m. wakeups.

action_tips:
  - "🪨 Finish workouts at least 3 hours before bed to allow body temperature to drop."
  - "⚡ Try 20 minutes of yoga, breathing, or stretching in the evening for relaxation."
  - "🌟 Exercise consistently in the morning or afternoon to support your circadian rhythm."
  - "🚫 Skip caffeine and high-intensity cardio late in the day — they delay melatonin."
  - "🤝 Cool down slowly and hydrate — it helps calm your nervous system before rest."

habit_strategy:
  strategy: "Body Clock Anchoring"
  explanation: "Sync movement with your natural rhythm to improve sleep quality."
  example: "Walk in morning sunlight, do strength at midday, keep evenings gentle with yoga or stretching."
  habit_tip: "Your body loves patterns — consistent timing helps your hormones and sleep work together."

motivation_nudge: "💖 Exercise is nature’s sleep medicine — but timing is your secret ingredient. Train earlier, unwind later, and let your body reset."
