    CBT helps you calm emotional storms by retraining thought patterns 💭. When hormones fluctuate, the brain's threat center overreacts — CBT strengthens the calm, logical part (your prefrontal cortex). You learn to catch thoughts like 'I can't handle this' and replace them with grounded, kind ones. Over time, this rewires your response to stress and builds resilience.

action_tips:
  - "🧠 Try the 3-step reframe: catch → challenge → change the thought."
  - "🪞 Replace 'I can't cope' with 'This will pass — I've handled this before.'"
  - "📝 Journal one balanced thought daily to reinforce new neural paths."
  - "🧘 Pair thought reflection with calm breathing for faster relief."

motivation_nudge: "🌿 Every reframe builds emotional muscle — your calm grows stronger with each try."

habit_strategy:
  principle: "Thought Awareness Loop"
  explanation: "Recognizing thoughts early prevents emotional spirals."
  example: "When self-criticism appears, pause and ask: 'Is this helpful or harmful?'"
  habit_tip: "💭 Awareness before reaction — that's your superpower."
