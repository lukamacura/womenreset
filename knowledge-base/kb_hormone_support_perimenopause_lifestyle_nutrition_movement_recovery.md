  "Hormones matter — but lifestyle is medicine too." 💜
  
  Your daily habits shape how your body experiences perimenopause. Every meal, movement, and moment of rest teaches your hormones how to behave. Fuel well, move often, recover deeply — these are your hormone's allies. They cool inflammation, stabilize blood sugar, and guard your heart and mind.
  
  No shortcut beats consistency, but every small step strengthens your foundation for lasting energy and balance 🌿.
  
  **The Three Pillars:**
  
  **1. Nutrition** — Anti-inflammatory eating supports hormone balance and metabolism. Think Mediterranean-style: colorful plants, healthy fats, lean proteins, fiber-rich whole grains.
  
  **2. Movement** — Strength training 2–3 times weekly protects bone, brain, and metabolism. Add daily walks and moderate cardio for heart health.
  
  **3. Recovery** — Sleep is your most powerful recovery tool. Poor sleep worsens insulin resistance, mood, and hot flashes. Stress management protects hormones by lowering cortisol.

action_tips:
  - "🕒 Schedule strength workouts like meetings: They protect bone, brain, and metabolism."
  - "🫐 Fill half your plate with colorful plants: Fiber and antioxidants cool inflammation and balance blood sugar."
  - "🧘 Create a 10-minute unwind ritual before bed: Stretch, journal, or breathe to lower cortisol."
  - "💦 Sip electrolyte water: Keeps you hydrated and may reduce hot flashes or dizziness."
  - "🚶‍♀️ Walk after meals: Supports digestion, blood sugar control, and steady energy."

motivation_nudge: "🌿 Aging is inevitable — decline isn't. The way you move, eat, and rest changes everything."

habit_strategy:
  principle: "Three-Pillar Habit Loop"
  explanation: "Building habits around nutrition, movement, and recovery turns menopause care into a lifestyle, not a project."
  example: "Pair a morning walk with protein-rich breakfast prep and a short evening wind-down — one action anchors the next."
  habit_tip: "Stack small actions: one meal, one workout, one good night's sleep — these compound into hormonal balance over time."
