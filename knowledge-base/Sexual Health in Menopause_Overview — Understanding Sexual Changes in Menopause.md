content_text: |
  Menopause may shift how desire feels — but it doesn't erase it 💜. As estrogen and testosterone dip, blood flow and sensitivity can decline, and stress or poor sleep can muffle libido. That's biology plus life changes — not brokenness. The good news: desire is retrainable. With rest, communication, gentle curiosity, and (when needed) hormonal or pelvic support, intimacy often becomes deeper and more intentional than before.

action_tips:
  - "📚 Learn what's physiologically normal: reduced lubrication, slower arousal, and thinner tissues are expected changes."
  - "🧠 Understand that libido changes involve hormones, neurotransmitters, blood flow, and life stress — not just one factor."
  - "📊 Identify which symptoms you're experiencing: desire changes, arousal difficulties, comfort issues, or orgasm changes."
  - "💬 Educate your partner about menopause's physical and emotional effects on sexuality."
  - "🗺️ Map your options: lifestyle changes, pelvic therapy, lubricants, hormonal treatments, or counseling."
