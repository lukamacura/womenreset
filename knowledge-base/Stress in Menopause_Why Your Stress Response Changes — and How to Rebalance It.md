  You're not imagining it — midlife stress hits differently 💜.

  When estrogen drops, your main stress hormone — cortisol — becomes more reactive and stays high longer. That creates a *stress cascade* that touches your mood, sleep, and metabolism.

  It doesn't mean you're weak. It means your nervous system is more sensitive and needs gentler recovery. The key is retraining your body to shift from *fight or flight* to *rest and digest* each day 🌿.

action_tips:
  - "🧘‍♀️ **Activate calm daily:** Try deep breathing, meditation, or gentle yoga to lower cortisol naturally."
  - "🚶‍♀️ **Move wisely:** Walking and strength work calm hormones better than intense cardio."
  - "☀️ **Protect sleep:** Keep your room cool, dark, and screen-free an hour before bed."
  - "🥗 **Eat regularly:** Pair protein and fiber at each meal to steady cortisol."
  - "💬 **Set boundaries:** Saying no protects your hormones — it's self-care, not selfishness."

motivation_nudge: "🌸 Your sensitivity isn't weakness — it's wisdom. Each calm breath rebuilds resilience."

follow_up_question: "Would you like to explore the physical signs of chronic stress in menopause, learn specific mindfulness practices that calm your nervous system, or understand how sleep and stress feed each other during this transition?"
