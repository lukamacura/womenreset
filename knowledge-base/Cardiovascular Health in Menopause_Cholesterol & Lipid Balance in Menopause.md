  If your cholesterol suddenly spiked after perimenopause started, you're not alone, and you're not imagining it. Many women watch their numbers jump 30, 40, even 50 points seemingly overnight—despite eating the same way they always have. This isn't your fault, and it's not about willpower. It's biochemistry.

  **Why this happens:**
  
  Estrogen does more than regulate your cycle—it actively manages how your liver produces and processes cholesterol. Specifically, estrogen helps your liver clear LDL ("bad" cholesterol) from your bloodstream, supports healthy HDL ("good" cholesterol) levels, and regulates triglyceride production.
  
  When estrogen declines during perimenopause and drops after menopause, your liver's cholesterol regulation shifts. LDL production increases. HDL often decreases. Triglycerides can rise. Your total cholesterol might jump from 180 to 240 in a matter of months—even if nothing else in your life has changed.

action_tips:
  - "🥑 Eat **fiber-rich meals** (oats, beans, vegetables) to bind excess cholesterol."
  - "🐟 Add **omega-3 fats** from salmon, sardines, or flaxseeds 3–4× weekly."
  - "🚶‍♀️ Move daily — **30 minutes of brisk walking** or resistance work boosts HDL."
  - "💊 Review your **lipid panel yearly** and discuss options with your clinician."

habit_strategy: "Stack a **5-minute walk after lunch** or swap butter for olive oil — these micro habits lower LDL over time without feeling restrictive."

motivation_nudge: "Every heart-healthy choice compounds 💪 — small shifts in meals, movement, and stress balance can reshape your lipid profile within weeks."
