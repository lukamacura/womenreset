  Doing stress *better* means teaching your body to recover faster 🌿.

  Balanced meals, mindful movement, and rest all tell your brain it's safe. Gentle strength work and Zone-2 cardio lower cortisol — too much intensity can raise it. Sleep and stable blood sugar prevent overactivation.

  Some women also find support through magnesium, adaptogens, or hormone therapy under medical guidance 💜.

action_tips:
  - "🥗 Eat balanced meals every 4–5 h with protein, fiber, and healthy fats to steady cortisol."
  - "🚶‍♀️ Choose walks or gentle cardio when tired — recovery is where strength grows."
  - "🧘‍♀️ Schedule 'parasympathetic breaks': breathe, stretch, or write a gratitude note."
  - "🛌 Prioritize rest, connection, and boundaries — they reset your stress system."
  - "💊 Ask your clinician about MHT or adaptogens like magnesium glycinate or ashwagandha."

motivation_nudge: "✨ Each calm breath, boundary, and balanced meal tells your body it's safe again."
