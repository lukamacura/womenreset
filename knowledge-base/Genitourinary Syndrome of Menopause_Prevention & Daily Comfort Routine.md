  Prevention starts long before discomfort appears. Daily care that supports **hydration, circulation, and balance** keeps vaginal and urinary tissues resilient even as estrogen declines.

  Simple consistency — staying hydrated, using moisturizers, moving daily, and keeping pH in balance — helps your body maintain natural moisture and comfort 💧.

action_tips:
  - "💧 Drink **1.5–2 liters of water daily** to support tissue hydration."
  - "🌿 Apply a **vaginal moisturizer** 2–3 times a week for ongoing comfort."
  - "👙 Choose **breathable cotton underwear**; avoid tight synthetic fabrics."
  - "🚶‍♀️ Move daily — even light walking improves blood flow to the pelvis."
  - "🧼 Wash gently with **unscented warm water** or mild pH-balanced cleanser."

motivation_nudge: "🌷 Consistency is your quiet superpower — every small act of care today protects your comfort tomorrow."
