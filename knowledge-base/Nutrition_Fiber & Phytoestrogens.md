  So many women tell me they feel 'slowed down' in digestion or energy during midlife 🌸.

  That’s where **fiber and phytoestrogens** come in. Fiber (25–35 g daily) helps steady blood sugar, improve digestion, and lower cholesterol. Phytoestrogens — gentle plant estrogens found in soy, flax, and legumes — can naturally support hormone balance and even calm hot flashes 💜.

  They’re not the same as HRT — just milder plant versions that work best when part of a colorful, fiber-rich diet.

action_tips:
  - "🥕 Add 1–2 cups of veggies to lunch and dinner."
  - "🌱 Sprinkle flax or chia seeds on oatmeal or smoothies."
  - "🥗 Enjoy soy foods (tofu, tempeh, miso, edamame) 2–3 times weekly."

habit_strategy: |
  **Small Swaps** — Simple daily swaps raise fiber and plant estrogen intake without effort.
  
  Trade white rice for quinoa or lentils once a day.
  
  🍽️ **Tip:** Tip: Swap one refined carb for a fiber-rich one daily — consistency beats perfection.

motivation_nudge: "💜 Every plant-based bite helps your gut, hormones, and mood find their rhythm again."
