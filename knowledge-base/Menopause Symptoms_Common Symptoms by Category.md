  Menopause and perimenopause bring changes across your whole body — not just hot flashes. Here's what's happening and why:

  **Brain & Mood**
  You might experience brain fog, forgetfulness, difficulty concentrating, mood swings, anxiety, or low mood. This happens because estrogen and progesterone affect serotonin, dopamine, and GABA — your feel-good and calm-down chemicals.

  **Sleep & Energy**
  Trouble falling or staying asleep, night sweats, fatigue even after sleeping, and early morning waking are common. Sleep disruption is often one of the first signs your hormones are shifting.

  **Temperature & Circulation**
  Hot flashes, night sweats, chills, heart palpitations, and dizziness occur because estrogen helps your brain regulate temperature — when it drops, your thermostat goes haywire.

  **Metabolic & Weight**
  Weight gain (especially around the belly), slower metabolism, insulin resistance, sugar cravings, and bloating happen as your metabolism adapts to lower estrogen and less muscle mass — it's not your fault.

  **Muscles, Joints & Bones**
  Joint stiffness, muscle soreness, frozen shoulder, loss of muscle tone, and lower bone density can develop. Estrogen protects collagen, bone, and connective tissue — without it, you recover slower.

  **Urogenital & Sexual Health**
  Vaginal dryness, painful sex, urinary urgency, recurrent UTIs, and lower libido are hormonal changes, not psychological — local estrogen can help restore comfort and function.

  **Skin, Hair & Nails**
  Dry itchy skin, hair thinning, brittle nails, acne, and loss of elasticity occur as collagen loss accelerates up to 30% in the first five years after menopause.

  **Digestive & Gut**
  Bloating, food intolerances, constipation, acid reflux, and changes in alcohol tolerance happen because hormones shape your gut bacteria, digestion speed, and inflammation.

  **Cardiovascular**
  Rising cholesterol, blood pressure, palpitations, and cold extremities reflect loss of estrogen protection on arteries. After menopause, heart disease risk catches up to men.

  **Sensory & Neurological**
  Headaches, tingling, tinnitus, dry eyes, and electric shock sensations can occur because nerves are estrogen-sensitive — when hormones drop, sensory signals can misfire.

action_tips:
  - Track which symptoms you're experiencing to discuss with your healthcare provider
  - Keep a symptom diary noting timing, severity, and triggers
  - Don't dismiss multiple symptoms as "just aging" — they may be hormonal
  - Ask your doctor about hormone testing if you're experiencing several symptoms
  - Remember that symptoms can start in perimenopause, years before periods stop

motivation_nudge: "You're not imagining it, and you're not alone. These symptoms are real, hormonal, and treatable. Understanding what's happening in your body is the first step toward feeling better."
