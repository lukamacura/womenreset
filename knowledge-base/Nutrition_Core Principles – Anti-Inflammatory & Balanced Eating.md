  I hear this from so many women — eating used to feel simple, and now it feels confusing 💜.

  The most effective menopause diet isn’t about restriction — it’s about **balance and nourishment**. Focus on colorful, anti-inflammatory foods: vegetables, fruits, lean proteins, healthy fats, and slow carbs that keep energy steady.

  Think Mediterranean style 🌿 — olive oil, fish, beans, nuts, and whole grains. Limit sugary snacks, processed foods, and alcohol. What matters most is **personalization**: notice how foods affect your mood, sleep, and digestion. Every meal is a small act of self-care.

action_tips:
  - "🥦 Fill half your plate with colorful plants every day."
  - "🐟 Add a palm-sized protein to each meal (fish, eggs, beans, tofu)."
  - "🥑 Use olive oil, nuts, or avocado instead of butter."
  - "🚫 Reduce sugar, alcohol, and processed foods for calmer energy and fewer hot flashes."

  **Food Awareness** — Tuning in to how food makes you feel builds body trust.
  
  Notice if bread leaves you tired or berries lift your energy.
  
  🍽️ **Tip:** Try this: jot a one-line food-mood note after meals for a week.
  
motivation_nudge: "💜 Every balanced, colorful meal is a step toward steadier energy and hormone harmony."
