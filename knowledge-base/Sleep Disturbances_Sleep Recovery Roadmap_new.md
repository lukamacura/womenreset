  I love that you’re ready to rebuild your sleep — that’s where true recovery begins 🌙.
  
  Think of this as a *Sleep Recovery Roadmap*, a gentle, layered process that helps your body, hormones, and brain remember how to rest deeply again. Each step adds calm, stability, and confidence in your natural rhythm 💜.

  Take it layer by layer — you don’t have to do it all at once. Progress, not perfection 🌸.

action_tips:
  - "💡 Start small: Choose one step this week — light, calm, or nutrition — and build from there."
  - "🧘 Pair energy and rest: Move during the day, wind down at night — this retrains sleep hormones."
  - "📖 Notice patterns: Track wake times, meals, and stress triggers — awareness is your teacher."

motivation_nudge: "🌷 Healing sleep isn’t about control — it’s about cooperation. Your body remembers how to rest."
