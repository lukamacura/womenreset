  Long desk hours can quietly fuel stiffness and inflammation 🪑. The solution isn’t major — it’s *micro-movement.*

  Every small posture change, stretch, or breath refresh tells your body it’s still alive and flowing 🌿. You’ll feel clearer and lighter by day’s end.

  - "⏱️ Move every 45 min — stand, stretch, or roll shoulders."
  - "💧 Hydrate often to lubricate joints."
  - "🪑 Keep feet flat, shoulders relaxed, hips slightly above knees."
  - "🌬️ Breathe slowly to lower cortisol."
  - "🚶‍♀️ Take hallway or outdoor walks for focus and circulation."
