  So many women tell me this 💜 — they want a stronger tummy, fewer leaks, and better posture but feel unsure where to start. The secret? It all begins with your **core and pelvic floor working together**.

  During menopause, lower estrogen and muscle loss weaken your deep support system — the muscles that stabilize your spine, hips, and bladder. When those weaken, you might notice back pain, poor posture, or leaks when coughing or sneezing. But your body can absolutely **relearn and rebuild strength at any age.**

  **Core vs Abs:**  
  Your abs are just the surface. Your **core** includes deeper layers — your transverse abdominis, diaphragm, and pelvic floor. These muscles form a pressure system that supports every move you make.

  🌿 **Benefits of training your core + pelvic floor:**  
  • Better posture and balance  
  • Fewer leaks and stronger bladder control  
  • Improved intimacy and confidence  
  • Less back and hip pain  
  • Steadier, more graceful movement

  🩷 **Quick Core + Pelvic Floor Routine (5–10 min):**  
  • Dead bug ×10 each side  
  • Bird-dog ×10 each side  
  • Side plank hold ×20 sec/side  
  • Glute bridge ×12  
  • Finish with 10–12 Kegels (5 sec hold each)

  👉 **Tip:** Exhale gently during the lift or squeeze — never hold your breath. Breath and movement work together to support your core safely.
