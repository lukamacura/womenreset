  Hormone changes can alter your brain's sleep architecture, and sometimes lifestyle tools need medical or therapeutic support. You have options:

  **HRT (hormone therapy)** can restore estrogen and progesterone balance, improving temperature regulation and deep sleep. **CBT-I (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia)** retrains your brain's relationship with rest—especially helpful when anxiety keeps you awake. **Gentle supplements** like magnesium or L-theanine can calm your nervous system without prescription.

  What matters most is a *personalized approach*—finding the right combination of medical support and daily habits 💜.

action_tips:
  - "💊 **Ask your doctor** about HRT or prescription medication if insomnia or hot flashes persist."
  - "🧠 **Try CBT-I** — a structured therapy that rewires anxiety-driven insomnia."
  - "🍒 Support relaxation chemistry: magnesium glycinate, tart cherry, or L-theanine may help."
  - "📓 **Track your symptoms** for 2–3 weeks before appointments to guide treatment choices."
  - "🌿 **Combine treatments with lifestyle habits** — light, nutrition, and NSDR amplify results."

motivation_nudge: "💖 Getting help isn’t giving up — it’s giving your body the balance it’s been asking for."
