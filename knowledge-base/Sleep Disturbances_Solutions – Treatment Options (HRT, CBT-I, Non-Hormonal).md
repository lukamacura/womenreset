  You’ve done the right things — light, calm, nutrition — but if sleep still feels fragile, you’re not alone 🌙.
  
  Hormone changes can alter your brain’s sleep architecture, so lifestyle tools sometimes need medical or therapeutic support. **HRT (hormone therapy)** can restore estrogen and progesterone balance, improving temperature regulation and deep sleep cycles. **CBT-I** retrains your brain’s relationship with rest — especially helpful for anxiety-driven insomnia.
  
  If you prefer non-hormonal paths, gentle aids such as magnesium, L-theanine, tart cherry, or valerian can calm your nervous system. What matters most is a *personalized plan* — blending medical precision with daily rhythms 💜.

action_tips:
  - "💊 **Ask your doctor** about HRT or prescription medication if insomnia or hot flashes persist."
  - "🧠 **Try CBT-I** — a structured therapy that rewires anxiety-driven insomnia."
  - "🍒 Support relaxation chemistry: magnesium glycinate, tart cherry, or L-theanine may help."
  - "📓 **Track your symptoms** for 2–3 weeks before appointments to guide treatment choices."
  - "🌿 **Combine treatments with lifestyle habits** — light, nutrition, and NSDR amplify results."

motivation_nudge: "💖 Getting help isn’t giving up — it’s giving your body the balance it’s been asking for."
