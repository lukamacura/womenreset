content_text: |
  As hormones decline, blood flow and nerve sensitivity can drop — making arousal slower and orgasms less intense. That doesn't mean pleasure is gone 💜. With pelvic-floor training, improved circulation, mindful arousal, and (when appropriate) local estrogen, sensation and intensity often return — deeper and more satisfying over time. Your body didn't forget pleasure — it needs clearer, slower signals.

action_tips:
  - "🦵 Practice pelvic floor exercises daily — think 'lifting' not 'clenching' — to boost blood flow and nerve response. Breathe deeply while you do them."
  - "💧 Use vaginal moisturizers 2-3x weekly to keep tissue healthy and responsive (over-the-counter gels or creams work well)."
  - "⏱️ Take your time — arousal often needs 20+ minutes now, and that's okay. Slower can mean deeper."
  - "🌊 Try 'edging' — get close to orgasm, pause, repeat — to rebuild intensity and discover what works now."
  - "🧘‍♀️ Use deep belly breathing during intimacy to relax pelvic tension and increase blood flow to the area."

  💬 Your body didn't forget pleasure — it needs clearer, slower signals.  
 

habit_strategy: |
  **Neuromuscular Retraining** — Daily pelvic activation paired with arousal awareness rebuilds orgasmic pathways.
  
  Every shower, do 5 slow Kegels while focusing on sensation — link muscle work to pleasure awareness.
  
  🌺 **Tip:** Pleasure is trainable — small daily practice creates big neurological change.
