  You can't think your way out of stress — but you can *breathe* your way through it 💜.

  Your vagus nerve connects your mind and body. When you breathe slowly, hum, or stretch gently, it tells your brain you're safe. This shifts you out of fight-or-flight and lowers cortisol.

  With daily practice, calm becomes your *default*, not your exception 🌿.

action_tips:
  - "🌬️ Try 4-7-8 breathing for 2–3 minutes when tension rises."
  - "🚶 Walk mindfully — focus on sights and sounds, not thoughts."
  - "🧘 Practice slow yoga or tai chi for 10 minutes daily."
  - "🎶 Hum, sing, or pray aloud — vibration activates your vagus nerve."
  - "📓 Write one gratitude or release note before bed to offload stress."

motivation_nudge: "🌸 Calm isn't passive — it's a daily practice your body learns to trust again."

habit_strategy:
  principle: "Daily Calm Anchors"
  explanation: "Short, repeated calm moments train your nervous system to reset faster."
  example: "Pause before each meal for three deep breaths — it lowers cortisol within seconds."
  habit_tip: "🌿 Consistency creates calm."
