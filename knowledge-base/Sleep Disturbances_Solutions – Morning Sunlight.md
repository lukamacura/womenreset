  So many women tell me, *“I’m tired all day but wide awake at night.”* ☀️ That’s your body clock asking for light!
  
  Morning sunlight is your most natural reset button. It raises cortisol for alertness, boosts serotonin for mood, and sets your melatonin timer for sleep 12–14 hours later. Even on cloudy days, outdoor light is 10–100× brighter than indoor light 🌤️.
  
  If you stay indoors all morning, your body clock drifts later — making it harder to fall asleep at night. The fix is simple: step outside soon after waking, ideally within the first hour. Consistency matters more than perfection — daily light trains your rhythm layer by layer 💛.

action_tips:
  - "🌅 **Get 10–20 minutes of outdoor light** within an hour of waking."
  - "🚶 Move a little: Combine light with a gentle walk or stretch to boost energy."
  - "🏡 **If indoors, sit by an open window** (not behind glass) for 20 minutes."
  - "🌤️ Don’t skip cloudy days: Natural light still resets your body clock."
  - "💡 In winter: Use a 10,000 lux light-therapy lamp for 20 minutes at breakfast."

motivation_nudge: "🌸 Every sunrise you meet whispers to your body, *“It’s time to wake, move, and shine again.”*"
