  Your bones are living tissue that requires daily nourishment 🌸. Calcium provides the mineral structure, vitamin D ensures calcium absorption, protein forms the bone matrix, and vitamin K₂ directs calcium to bones (not arteries). Magnesium, phosphorus, and trace minerals also play supporting roles.
  
  Food-first approach is ideal, but supplements fill gaps when dietary intake falls short. Most women need 1200mg calcium, 1000-2000 IU vitamin D, and 25-30g protein per meal for optimal bone health. The key is consistency — bones rebuild slowly, requiring steady nutrient supply day after day 💜.

action_tips:
  - "🥛 Consume 1200mg calcium daily from food: 3-4 servings dairy (milk, yogurt, cheese) OR fortified plant milk + leafy greens + canned salmon with bones + fortified tofu."
  - "☀️ Supplement vitamin D3: 1000-2000 IU daily if blood level under 30 ng/mL; take with meals containing fat for absorption; retest after 3 months."
  - "🥩 Eat 25-30g protein per meal (not just daily total): eggs + Greek yogurt (breakfast), chicken + beans (lunch), fish + quinoa (dinner)."
  - "🥦 Include vitamin K₂-rich foods: natto, hard cheeses, egg yolks, grass-fed butter (or supplement 90-120 mcg MK-7 form daily)."
  - "💊 Time supplements strategically: calcium divided doses (600mg max per dose for absorption), vitamin D with largest meal, separate from thyroid medication by 4 hours."

motivation_nudge: "🌿 Every nourishing bite is bone medicine — food and supplements work together to rebuild strength from the inside."

habit_strategy: |
  **Nutrient Stacking** — Building meals that combine bone-supporting nutrients maximizes absorption and creates consistent supply.
  
  Breakfast: Greek yogurt (protein + calcium) + berries + ground flaxseed, taken with vitamin D supplement = complete bone nutrition.
  
  🍽️ **Tip:** Create a “Bone Plate” visual: 1/4 plate protein, 1/4 calcium-rich food, 1/2 vegetables — simple template for every meal.
