  Forget chasing macro numbers — your body isn’t a spreadsheet 💜.

  In menopause, hormone shifts make blood-sugar and energy balance more important than perfect ratios. Start meals with **protein first**, add **colorful vegetables**, include **healthy fats** for satisfaction, and save **carbs for activity or evenings** to aid recovery and sleep.

  This natural rhythm steadies insulin, reduces cravings, and supports muscle, mood, and metabolism without strict tracking 🌿.

action_tips:
  - "🍗 Begin each meal with protein (25–30 g) to control hunger and support muscle."
  - "🥬 Fill half your plate with vegetables or salad for fiber and fullness."
  - "🥑 Add a thumb-sized serving of healthy fats like olive oil, nuts, or avocado."
  - "🍠 Include slow carbs (oats, lentils, quinoa, sweet potatoes) near workouts or dinner for steady energy and better sleep."

habit_strategy: |
  **Plate Method** — Using your plate as a visual guide keeps meals balanced without tracking.
  
  ½ veggies, ¼ protein, ¼ smart carbs, plus healthy fats.
  
  🍽️ **Tip:** Build by sections, not numbers — simple, satisfying, sustainable.
  
motivation_nudge: "🌸 Balanced plates beat strict diets — your body thrives on rhythm, not restriction."
