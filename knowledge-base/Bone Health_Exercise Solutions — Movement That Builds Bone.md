  Your bones respond to mechanical stress by getting stronger 💪. Weight-bearing exercise and resistance training send powerful signals to build new bone tissue. The key is progressive loading — gradually increasing the challenge so bones adapt and strengthen over time.
  
  These types of exercise work together: weight-bearing activities (walking, jogging, dancing) load your skeleton through gravity, resistance training (weights, bands) creates direct force on bones, jump training (squats, skater jumps, box jumps) builds bone density and balance exercises prevent falls. Consistency matters more than intensity — 2-3 strength sessions weekly plus daily movement creates lasting bone-building stimulus 🌿.

action_tips:
  - "🏋️ Perform resistance training 2-3x weekly: squats 3 sets x 10-12 reps, lunges 3x10 each leg, deadlifts 3x8-10, push-ups 3x8-12, rows 3x10-12."
  - "🚶 Complete 30+ minutes daily weight-bearing activity: brisk walking, jogging, stair climbing, dancing, hiking (swimming/cycling don't count — no gravity load)."
  - "📈 Progress gradually: add weight/resistance every 2-3 weeks once current level feels easy (bone responds to NEW challenge, not routine)."
  - "🤸 Include jump training (squats, skater jumps, box jumps) to your workout."
  - "🤸 Include 10 minutes daily balance work: single-leg stands (30 sec each side), tandem walking, tai chi, tree pose."
  - "⏰ Time exercise strategically: morning or early afternoon optimal (avoids evening cortisol spike that can interfere with bone building)."

motivation_nudge: "🌸 Every rep, every step sends a message to your bones: 'Build stronger, I need you.' They listen and respond beautifully."

habit_strategy: |
  **Progressive Mechanical Loading** — Bones adapt to increasing mechanical stress by depositing new bone tissue — consistency plus progression equals growth.
  
  Week 1-2: bodyweight squats. Week 3-4: hold 5lb weights. Week 5-6: 8lb weights. Track progression in workout log.
  
  📋 **Tip:** Keep a simple exercise log: date, exercises, sets/reps/weight. Seeing progress motivates consistency and guides safe progression.

follow_up_question: "Would you like to explore strength training to build muscle and protect bones, learn balance and stability drills to reduce fall risk, or understand jump training to add safe impact for bone density?"
